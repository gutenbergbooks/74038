<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
THE MAN IN THE MEADOW
</h3>

<p>
As she walked across the meadow, carrying
a basket in one hand, and swinging a
a dainty blue hood in the other, Margaret
Byrckmann made a picture that was
pleasing to behold.  She looked up as she moved
along, but her eyes went down again before the
dazzling sun which was setting in a blaze of red
splendour, silhouetting the battlemented walls of
the city.
</p>

<p>
She gave this evening beauty scanty attention,
for her dark eyes were watching the meadow.  Then
a cry of pleasure broke from her lips, and she
hastened forward; but before she had gone far her
face filled with disappointment, and she stopped
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was Herman!" she exclaimed,
almost petulantly.
</p>

<p>
She watched a man who was walking wearily.
He looked dusty and wayworn, and the movement
on the beaten path seemed to be toilsome and
painful.  She thought he must have travelled far,
for he carried a heavy-looking wallet on his back,
and the staff in his hand was used as though it
was real labour to go forward.
</p>

<p>
"He is tired to death, poor man!" she muttered,
her sympathy getting the better of her disappointment,
and she crossed the meadow to intercept
him.
</p>

<p>
Until he halted, in sheer weariness, to look around
for some spot&mdash;a tree, or a bush&mdash;anything that
would screen him from the glare of the sun, the man
in the meadow did not see her; but the moment
he spoke, Margaret knew that he was not one of her
countrymen.
</p>

<p>
"Mistress, how far is it to the city?" he asked,
in a foreign accent.
</p>

<p>
"That is it," she answered softly, and full of
concern, for the stranger's limbs trembled, and his
hand shook when he raised it to set his cap straight.
With the other he gripped his staff tightly, lest he
should fall.
</p>

<p>
"Yonder?" he exclaimed, gazing beneath his
hand.  "I did not see it in the blaze of the sunset.
It seems a long way off."
</p>

<p>
"More than two miles," said Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"Two miles!" was the dismayed response;
"so far as that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  But how will you think to enter the
city, since 'tis but a few minutes to sundown?
They close the gates the moment the sunset bell
has stopped."
</p>

<p>
"Is it so?" came the discouraged response.
"I forgot that it is not here as it is in England,
where our walled cities are so few.  Then I must lie
in the meadow till sunrise."
</p>

<p>
"You could enter if you had a pass," said
Margaret, who was concerned for the stranger; for,
in spite of his wallet and the travel stains, she saw
that he was no common wanderer.
</p>

<p>
"But I have no pass."
</p>

<p>
The stranger and the girl, standing in silence,
while the slanting sunlight was sending long shadows
over the grass, looked around for some place&mdash;a hut,
or a barn, or anything where a man who was tired
could lie down and sleep; but there was nothing
of that sort in view; no village, far or near.
</p>

<p>
"There is no place that I can see," said Margaret,
who had never noticed how empty the fields were of
houses until now, when they were so badly needed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well!  I may not complain," the stranger
muttered.  "Why should I?  Even the dear Lord
saw many a sun go down, and had nowhere to lay
His head."
</p>

<p>
He spoke more to himself, as if forgetful that the
girl was near, until she moved.
</p>

<p>
"I will sit down under the chestnut tree, and take
my chance, unless your home is anywhere outside
the city walls."
</p>

<p>
"I live in the city, sir, but they know me, and I
have a permit to get in after the gates are shut,"
said Margaret.  "And yet I am so sorry for you,"
she went on softly.
</p>

<p>
"If I only knew where I might find some food I
would not care," the stranger said, gazing around
him, his hand above his eyes.
</p>

<p>
A low call came while he was speaking, like the
sweet note of the last evening bird.  It travelled
over the meadow from the river, and Margaret
looked up quickly.  Her dark eyes flashed, and her
lips parted with pleasure; then she sent back an
answering cry, full of soft, rich music.  The stranger,
watching her pale face, saw the flush of colour
darken it, and, worn out though he was, he marvelled
at her beauty, and smiled to himself.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me for a moment, sir," she exclaimed,
when her answer ended.  "I will come back
again."
</p>

<p>
While she spoke she moved away with hurried
steps to meet a young man who had appeared on the
bank of the broad river.  He had been bending low
to fasten his boat to the root of one of the willows,
but when he saw her coming he came to meet her,
and, throwing his arms about her, he kissed her till
she asked for breathing time.
</p>

<p>
"There's a stranger yonder, Herman, and he will
see us," she exclaimed, her face burning at the
thought.
</p>

<p>
"A stranger?" Herman cried, flushing at being
caught like that, and the girl's laugh rang out when
she held back, still in his arms, and saw the colour
of his browned face deepen.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis what I have told you, Herman, again and
again," she said roguishly.  "You ought to look
before you love."
</p>

<p>
"Look before I love!" the young fellow blurted.
"I looked, and saw a girl so sweet and lovely that I
lost my heart at once.  That's looking before you
love, is it not?  But where's the stranger?  I
can't see anyone."
</p>

<p>
Her lover's arm was still about her when Margaret
turned to point to the man she left standing near
the chestnut tree.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone!" she exclaimed, in real surprise, and,
breaking away from Herman, she ran to the spot
where she and the stranger had been standing.
Then a cry of dismay broke from her lips.  The man
lay in a heap in the hollow, and, leaping into it, she
dropped on her knees, and gazed at him with startled
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Is he dead?" cried Herman, who had come at
her heels, and now was in the hollow by her side.
</p>

<p>
"God forbid!" the girl exclaimed, beginning to
chafe the unconscious man's hands.
</p>

<p>
"He came here while I was waiting for you,
Herman.  He wanted to know how far it was to
the city, and he seemed so distressed when I told
him the gates would soon be shut&mdash;long before he
could reach them.  We cannot leave him here, poor
man!"
</p>

<p>
She broke off almost abruptly at a thought that
came.
</p>

<p>
"I might have known!  He asked if there was
any place where he could buy some food, but when
your call came I left him to go to you.  It was so
thoughtless of me!" she added reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't come to anyone better," said
Herman, with a laugh, but only in jest, for he fully
appreciated her regret.
</p>

<p>
"He must be hungry," the girl exclaimed.  "He
shall have some of this to help him on till he can get
a good meal."
</p>

<p>
She drew her basket closer, and gave it to her
lover, bidding him open a jar that was there.  Then
she put her arms around the shoulders of the
helpless one, who was crouching in a bundled heap,
and drew him to her, so that his head rested on
her bosom.  Putting out her hand for the jar, she
gently poured some of the cordial between his lips.
</p>

<p>
The man swallowed it slowly, and presently his
eyes opened.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I remember!" he exclaimed weakly.  "I
have travelled far to-day, and, not being well,
the heat and hunger have been too much for me."
</p>

<p>
"Drink more of this," urged Margaret, and when
she held the jar once more to the parched lips the
stranger drank the cool draught almost eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Now eat this," said Margaret, with a pleasing
peremptoriness, when, with one of her hands, she
drew a parcel from her basket, and deftly unfolded
the spotless cloth which wrapped round something.
It was food, and she placed it so that he might help
himself while she still held him close to her bosom.
He seemed too weak otherwise to sit up.
</p>

<p>
The sun was now gone down, and the heavens
were glowing with many-coloured splendour.  Away
to the west lay the emerald sea, whose silver-crested
waves rolled against the sapphire shores,
while purple islands dotted the waters and rested
there in stately stillness, and the snowclad
mountains on the mainland caught the changing glory.
Some of that last beauty of the summer's evening
entered the little hollow where these three were
grouped together, one helpless in his weariness, the
others wondering what they should do with him.
</p>

<p>
"I am another man," said the stranger presently,
sitting up, while Margaret sat back on her heels,
watching his face keenly.  "Whoever you may be,
may the Lord reward you both, for dealing so
kindly towards me."
</p>

<p>
He attempted to rise, but failed completely.
Not until Herman lifted him in his strong arms
could he feel his feet, and even then he swayed,
and flung his arm about the young man's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"That does not look like walking two miles,"
said Herman seriously.  "Do you know anyone
in the city with whom you thought to stay?"
</p>

<p>
The stranger shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I started on my way this morning, and,
from what they told me, I expected to arrive in
good time to look for a lodging; but the heat was
so overpowering that I was forced to go slowly,
and here I am, outside, and the city gates are
closed."
</p>

<p>
Herman, still with the man's weight on his
shoulder, wondered what he could do for this
helpless one, whose face had won his confidence.
Presently his perplexity passed.
</p>

<p>
"I have it!" he exclaimed.  "I was to bring
in that man whom the Burgomaster sent me to
meet, and my permit was to admit both him and
me by the water-gate.  'Tis the very thing, since
Manton has proved a laggard, and word has come
that he won't be here for a week or more.  I will
take you to my mother's house, master," he
exclaimed.  "Margaret, unstrap the wallet, and carry
it, while I take him to the boat."
</p>

<p>
The girl's fingers moved about the buckles, and
in a little while they were on the move, Herman
giving the worn-out man the help of his strong arm.
He stopped before they had gone far.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p7"></a>
"We can't go on like this," he said decisively;
and, taking the stranger in his arms bodily, he went
forward with strong, swift strides, but as gently as
he knew how, towards the river.  The boat was
there, and laying his burden in the stern, and bidding
Margaret sit beside him, Herman pulled the little
craft down the darkening stream, not pausing till
he reached the water-gate.
</p>

<p>
He answered the challenge.  What he said satisfied
the sergeant of the gate, and, mounting the
green-stained steps, now once more with the
stranger in his arms, and Margaret following
anxiously, lest her lover's feet should slip, he stood
on the topmost step of all, and waited for her.
Passing along the dark and narrow streets, they
paused at last at the door of Herman's home.
</p>

<p>
Margaret threw the door open and waited for him
to pass in.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," he cried, when, at the end of the
passage, he stood in an open doorway, "I have
brought you a lodger!"
</p>

<p>
The woman who sat at the table looked up, her
needle half-drawn through the cloth, and her blue
eyes opened so wide that Herman laughed at his
mother's surprise.
</p>

<p>
Mistress Bengel started to her feet in wonder at
seeing her son so burdened.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?" she exclaimed.  "Is he ill?"
she asked, before there was time to answer her first
question.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, not ill, but worn out.  I will take him
upstairs to the empty chamber."
</p>

<p>
He turned as he spoke, and mounted the stairs.
At the top, before he thrust the door open with his
foot, he called down to the others:
</p>

<p>
"Mother, you will find that I have brought home
an angel unawares."
</p>

<p>
He laughed again.  Yet he felt that it was no
jest.  He had watched the stranger, and
something told him he was above the common run of
men.
</p>

<p>
When the stranger lay quiet on the bed, sighing
contentedly to find himself at rest, and clasping his
hands for silent prayer before he slept, Herman
turned away and crept down the stairs softly.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," he said, in little more than a whisper,
when he entered the living-room and closed the
door behind him noiselessly, "do you guess who
that man is?"
</p>

<p>
The woman watched her son's face, and marvelled
at the kindling of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"No, my boy, I cannot.  I did not so much as
see his face."
</p>

<p>
Herman gazed around the room before he spoke
again.  His eyes turned to the window, as if he
thought someone might be peering in.  He went to
the passage and looked along it.  He did more than
that, for he went to the street door and, opening it,
looked into the dark street, but it was silent, and
he saw no one.  There was not so much as a footstep
to be heard anywhere.
</p>

<p>
"Margaret," he asked, when he came back to the
two wondering women, "did anyone, think you,
see us enter the house?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Herman," the girl responded, in a whisper,
awed by this mystery Herman had brought downstairs
with him.  "I looked about, but I cannot
tell you why, and I saw no one.  It was so dark.
But what of it?"
</p>

<p>
The question came eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"What of it?"
</p>

<p>
Herman's voice sank to a scarcely audible whisper.
"The man upstairs, mother, is a friend of Doctor
Martin Luther.  He is the Englishman for whom
such tireless search is being made, and his name is
William Tyndale!  What would the Familiars of
the Holy House say if they knew that he was here!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE MAN ON THE STAIRS
</h3>

<p>
Margaret stood at the door of her home
in the Merdenstrasse, and looked in all
directions anxiously before she stepped
into the street and closed the door
behind her.  Her face, lit up dimly by the
lantern which hung over the shallow portico,
would have shown anyone who saw it that the
errand on which her father had sent her was
distasteful; for it was dark, and the rain was coming
down in an uncomfortable drizzle.
</p>

<p>
It was not any unwillingness which made her
hesitate.  It was this going at night, when all
that was of ill repute came out of hiding&mdash;the
scum, one might call it, of the city&mdash;and made the
streets dangerous.
</p>

<p>
The Merdenstrasse was empty, but there were
sounds which made the delicately nurtured girl
shrink.  Among them was the clash of steel
somewhere, which meant a savage onslaught on a
wayfarer who had drawn his sword and was fighting
desperately in self-defence.  The scream of a
woman was heard.  The ribald jests and foul songs
sung by men who were leaving the taverns where
they had spent hours in heavy drinking and
gambling came on the night air.  At times she
heard the tramp of horses' hoofs, and the clink of
chain and armour, reminding her that the mounted
watch were on their rounds, to make some sort of show
of maintaining law and order.  But largely it was mere
pretence, and it brought no assurance to Margaret.
</p>

<p>
Whenever she heard the approach of some
drunken roysterers, hooting, and shouting out their
songs, she drew into the shadow of a portico to
hide herself, and once or twice, when the sounds
were more than usually startling, she ventured in
at some stable door, and waited in the darkness till
the way was clear again.
</p>

<p>
Constantly in that night journey through the
drizzle she thought of the stranger whom she and
Herman had brought into the city some time before.
She did not know how he spent his days, closeted in
his room in Herman's home, where he sat from
early morning until sundown.  What his task was,
neither she nor Herman nor his mother knew.  Yet
they felt that what he did was of the first importance
in the man's estimation, and secret.  There was no
doubt as to the secrecy, for whenever he left his
chamber for meals, or, after darkness had set in, went
into the streets for air and exercise, he locked his
papers in a strong oaken chest that was in the room.
He had asked for the use of it when he saw it there,
and never left the place without turning the key,
and bringing it away with him.
</p>

<p>
What was that work which so absorbed him?
There was never any trace of it when Mistress
Bengel put his room tidy in his occasional absence
for the night walk in the streets; nothing on the
table but an odd scrap or two of paper without a
mark to indicate what he had been doing, and the
pens with which he wrote.
</p>

<p>
Surely there was nothing wrong in this task in
which he was engaged!  Such a man, the friend of
Martin Luther, would not stoop to what was ignoble
and unworthy!
</p>

<p>
Margaret had the feeling whenever she thought
of him, and more this night than usual, that Master
Tyndale's deep thoughts were at work, and that
he was bent on holy purposes.
</p>

<p>
Something had made Herman and his mother, as
well as Margaret, lock up in their hearts that secret
fact, that such a man was in the house; for, while
he never asked them to be silent, they had the idea
that trouble would come, disaster, indeed, if it were
whispered abroad that William Tyndale was inside
the walls of the city.
</p>

<p>
She was thinking of this, and forgetful of the
drizzling rain, when a man's arms were flung
around her, the cold hands passing over her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Who am I?" was the laughing question.
</p>

<p>
Her alarm was gone in an instant, and her laughter
burst out on the night air.  She drew down the
hands and kissed them; then, swinging round, she
held up her lips for the man to kiss.
</p>

<p>
"Why is my sweetheart out alone and at this
time?" asked Herman, seriously now, for it was
never well for a woman, and much less his own
darling, to be alone in the dark streets at so late
an hour.
</p>

<p>
"My father asked me to carry a message to his
foreman," Margaret answered, as they walked on,
hand in hand.  "He had no help for it but to send
me to Gropper."
</p>

<p>
Talking quietly, they came to a house in the
Wendenstrasse, behind the cathedral, and, leaving
Herman in the street, Margaret opened the door,
moved along the dark passage, and, finding the
stairs, groped her way up them, counting the doors
until she came to the room she was seeking.
</p>

<p>
She gave her message, and turned to go.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see you to the door, and part way home,
Mistress Margaret," said the man, standing, and
reaching for his cap.
</p>

<p>
"There is no need, John.  Herman Bengel is
outside, waiting for me," the girl said, her pretty
face flushing.
</p>

<p>
"To the door, then, for the stairs are awkward,"
said Gropper, with a smile, for he had known the
girl from her babyhood, and they moved down the
stairs together.
</p>

<p>
They had not gone more than a few steps when
they halted, for a man was ascending, carrying a
candle which he shielded with his hand, and the
light falling on his face showed it plainly.  A
moment later he had passed into a room on the
landing below.  Margaret heard Gropper gasp, and
it sounded so much like a suppressed cry of dismay
that she turned involuntarily, but could not see
the man's face at all, not even his form in the
darkness.
</p>

<p>
"What does that man want here?" Gropper
muttered, putting out his hand, and holding the
girl by the sleeve to stay her from going farther.
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" she asked, in a startled whisper,
for something was surely wrong, or a strong-minded
man like Gropper would not be so put out.
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" the answer followed, and the
words were whispered in her ear, in trembling tones.
"He is that Argus-eyed heresy hunter who goes
by the name of Cochlaeus.  Surely, mistress, you
have heard of him?  He is a Deacon of the Church
of the Blessed Virgin in Frankfort, and when he
ever comes to our city there is trouble for some poor
soul who has dared to have anything to do with
the Reformation doctrines."
</p>

<p>
Margaret had not lost a word, and she shivered,
for the man's reputation was wide, and thrilled so
many with a sense of dread.
</p>

<p>
They moved on almost unwillingly, going down the
stairs with stealth, afraid lest they should attract
the attention of this man who had disappeared
into the room below.  They had to pass the door,
and to their alarm it stood slightly ajar.
</p>

<p>
Neither of them had any wish to play the part of
eavesdropper, and were passing on, but as they
moved they caught sight of a man who sat at a
table in the room, as well as of the other who was
in the act of blowing out the candle.  But what
they heard held them both spellbound.
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus either did not notice that the door was
partly open, or he was careless as to whether his
words were overheard.
</p>

<p>
"Buchsel," he exclaimed, in a jubilant tone,
"I have made a discovery&mdash;a wonderful one!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" was the response of the man who
was gazing at Cochlaeus questioningly, but in a
tone of perplexity.  It was plain that he was
wondering why the Deacon of the Blessed Virgin
was in the city, and coming to his room of all
others.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I have made a discovery!  That accursed
English heretic&mdash;that limb of Satan!&mdash;William
Tyndale&mdash;is here, within the city walls, and I can
give a broad guess as to what he is doing.  You
remember how he started the translation of the
Bible in England?"
</p>

<p>
He paused, but Buchsel's only response was a
nod, for he was waiting for Cochlaeus to tell his
story, which he did, not knowing of those two who
were standing outside and heard every word with
growing dismay.
</p>

<p>
"He must be here at his old work&mdash;that devil's
work, I call it!&mdash;translating the Scriptures, meaning
to scatter his pestilential stuff far and wide, seducing
the people who read it to heresy."
</p>

<p>
The man at the table stared at Cochlaeus incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"William Tyndale, that arch-heretic, here, in
this city, did you say?" he asked, in an amazed
tone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I said 'here.'  Where could that mean but
in this city?"
</p>

<p>
Margaret's heart beat so wildly that she held
her hands to her bosom as if to still it; but she
waited eagerly for what would follow.  There was
no thought about eavesdropping now, much as she
abhorred it, for she was asking herself what this
would mean for the man who was lodging in
Herman's home.
</p>

<p>
"Where does he lodge?" asked Buchsel, standing
up so suddenly that the chair fell to the
floor noisily.  He was staring hard at the heresy
hunter.
</p>

<p>
Margaret felt faint with fear of what the answer
might be.
</p>

<p>
"Where?  I've got to find out.  He is here in
the city.  I know that much.  But he shall be
found, and then&mdash;ah, me!&mdash;I will hand him over
to the tormentors.  He shall be lodged in the
dungeon of the Holy House, and the Familiars shall
deal with him!"
</p>

<p>
He paused, and there was silence for a few
moments&mdash;silence so intense to Margaret that she
could hear her heart-beats and the quick breathing
of the startled man at her side.
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
"Only to-day I heard it, not an hour since, in
fact.  I was passing the Gurzenich, where two men
were talking in whispers, but my sharp ears&mdash;&mdash;  Buchsel,"
he broke off, "if ever you go on the hunt
for heretics, be sure to thank God if He has given you
a quick ear!  He has given me that, and I praise
Him!  My sharp ears caught the words, for I was
going softly, my noiseless shoes giving no token of
my passing in the dense darkness, so I halted,
scarcely daring to breathe lest I should betray my
presence."
</p>

<p>
"And the man&mdash;what did he say?" interposed
the other, for Cochlaeus went so slowly
with his story, lingering over it as though he
enjoyed it.
</p>

<p>
"Ah yes!  He said that William Tyndale was
inside the walls, somewhere, that he had spoken
with him, and had been told that he was prospering
with his translation here, because England had
become too hot to hold him.  And that was not
all.  He was on the look out for a printer who would
put his vile sheets through the press!  This accursed
printing!" Cochlaeus burst forth, in savage anger.
"It will be the ruin of the Church!  It will render
the whole world Lutheran, unless we find the fellow
and crush him!"
</p>

<p>
Silence followed again, and those who stood on
the landing could not move on.  They seemed
compelled to take the risk of discovery rather than
miss what was to follow.
</p>

<p>
"What do you propose to do?" asked Buchsel,
presently.
</p>

<p>
"Burn the printing-press, and the printer, if I
can induce the authorities of the city to display
sufficient spirit.  And if I can lay my hand on
that fellow, Tyndale, he, too, shall burn, and
all the papers he has shall go to the flames with
him.  God help me, and give me the joy of doing it!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the speaker crossed the floor, and
slammed the door, leaving Margaret and her
companion in the darkness.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THE PICTURE IN THE FIRE
</h3>

<p>
When Margaret stepped into the street she
was trembling with anxiety.  Herman,
who was waiting for her, saw by the
light of one of the swinging oil lamps
that her face was white, and he marked the startled
look in her eyes, as well as her trembling hands when
she put one out for him to lead her.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong, little woman?" he asked in
some concern, dropping her hand and putting an
arm around her shoulder, walking with her thus
along the uneven and slippery pavement.
</p>

<p>
"I dare not tell you here, in the street," she
answered in a frightened whisper, looking up at
her lover's face.  "Oh, the very stones of the city
have ears.  Let us talk of something else until
we get to your home.  Then I will tell you all."
</p>

<p>
She shivered as she spoke, and looked behind her,
gripping one of Herman's hands, for she seemed to
feel the approach of that man Cochlaeus, or, still
worse, the coming of one of the cloaked and hooded
Familiars of the Inquisition.  Herman felt her
shudder, and tightened his arm about her to give
her confidence.  Scarcely a word passed between
them until they reached his home.
</p>

<p>
When they stepped into the dark passage, and
Herman closed the door, Margaret turned and thrust
the bolt into its socket.
</p>

<p>
"What's that for?" asked Herman, surprised at
the movement.
</p>

<p>
"It will keep out all intruders," she exclaimed,
and moved on to the door of the room in which
Mistress Bengel was busy with her sewing at the
table.
</p>

<p>
The woman looked up with a smile, but when she
saw the girl's face the smile vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Has anything frightened you, my child?" she
asked, dropping her work from her hand and
looking at Margaret with great concern.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," the girl answered, going forward, but
halting part way to look behind her.  "I bolted the
street door, Herman, so I suppose none can hear
what I am going to say?"
</p>

<p>
"It's safe, my love, and no one can come in,"
said Herman, wondering still more; for he had
never known her like this before.
</p>

<p>
They sat before the fire, but Margaret would only
sit where she could see the door.  Then the story
of the man upon the stairs was told, and what she
and Gropper had heard as they listened.
</p>

<p>
The faces of her listeners blenched, for the
penalties of heresy were many and fearful.
</p>

<p>
"They talk in that manner of that godly man
who is under our roof," exclaimed the elder woman
in tremulous tones.  "Herman, do you realise
Master Tyndale's danger?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, mother, but we must contrive to save
him," Herman answered, wiping his face, which
had gone damp with the horror of these
possibilities.  "That man, Cochlaeus, must not find
him!"
</p>

<p>
"He must not!" cried the mother, in
suppressed emotion.  "No, he must not!  Please
God, they shall not take him!  And yet," she
added, with a shudder, "what can we do?  What
has anyone ever done, when those wolf-hounds of
the Inquisition were on the trail?  Oh, why did
the poor man come here, into the very jaws of
danger?"
</p>

<p>
She buried her face in her hands, and sobbed, for
her memory was busy in those moments, and she had
in mind the penalty that had been levied on one who
was so dear to her, and who would never come
home again.
</p>

<p>
The others watched her, their own eyes blurred
with tears, for they guessed what her sorrow was,
and what her memory was telling her.  They sat
in silence, speechless, because they saw that words
would be of no avail.  They thought, as well, while
Herman's mother rested her elbows on the table
and wept in silence, of their own helplessness, to say
nothing of their own danger, if William Tyndale
were to be found in this home of theirs.  The only
way to escape punishment was by betrayal, but
that could never be; and Herman clenched his
hands and closed his teeth tightly in keeping with
his resolution.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," he said, breaking the stillness, "we
shall not betray Master Tyndale?"
</p>

<p>
"Betray him?" his mother cried, looking up,
her face, tear-wet though it was, almost indignant
at the bare suggestion.  "God helping us, never,
my son!  God sent him here for some wise purpose,
and we must do our solemn best, my boy, to save
him.  He's doing God's work, although I wot not
what it is.  But what did he say yesterday, when
I expostulated with him about working so strenuously?
'Wist ye not, mistress, that I must be
about my Father's business?  I must&mdash;I can do no
other!&mdash;I must work the work of Him that sent
me!'  I can't forget that, Herman."
</p>

<p>
"Then you will never give him up?  Oh, I am so
glad," exclaimed Margaret, leaning forward and
laying her own soft hand on the other woman's.
</p>

<p>
"Give him up?  God do so to me, and more, if I
betray the saintly man!" the widow said, in tones
that left no doubt.
</p>

<p>
It was growing late, and Margaret got up to go,
knowing that they would be anxious at home.
Herman stood up to go with her, and they went
into the passage.  When they walked softly past
the door of the front room where Master Tyndale
worked it was slightly ajar, and a streak of light
fell across the floor of the passage and on the
wall.  They saw him seated at the table, the candle
light shining on his face, and his elbows on the
table, and near by a pile of manuscript.  His hands
were clasped, and his eyes closed.  He was speaking,
and the low-spoken words came to them plainly.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Lord, did I not solemnly vow, long years
ago, that if my life were long enough, I would cause
the boy who driveth the plough to know the
Scriptures?"
</p>

<p>
There was a pause in the prayer, and they watched
his face, which for a moment he covered with his
hands; but he lifted it again, since the prayer was
not yet ended.  There was more to hear, and this
time the words came even more earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"O God, the task set for me is great.  The burden
is almost too heavy for me!  And I am compassed
about with dangers.  I tremble lest something
should come to bring ruin to my endeavours.  Yet,
Lord, it is not the thought of threatening death
that troubles me.  My fear is, lest my enemies
should compass my destruction before I have done
my work, and placed the Word of God within the
reach of the people at home.  Spare me until I
have fulfilled my task, and then I will say, 'Lord,
now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace.'"
</p>

<p>
They watched him.  They were unable to tear
themselves away.  It was something to hear this
holy man pleading with God, asking for nothing
for himself, but only for time to complete his work,
and ready after that to live or die, as God would
say it should be.
</p>

<p>
Tyndale unclasped his hands and, taking up his
pen, began to write as a man would whose time for
work was limited, and whose salvation depended
on the completion of the task set for him.
</p>

<p>
Herman and Margaret went along the passage
in silence, almost in stealth, and, closing the street
door after them softly, they hurried towards the girl's
home in haste.  When they stopped at her father's
door, Margaret gripped her lover's arm tightly.
</p>

<p>
"Look, Herman," she whispered.  She did not
point with her finger, but he saw in what direction
Margaret was gazing.  On the other side of the
street were two men, both looking at her father's
house, and Margaret gasped when the lantern,
swinging in the night breeze, cast a light on their
faces.  One was Cochlaeus, but Herman did not
know him, nor had he ever seen the other; but
the girl knew him for the man she had seen at the
table while she and John Gropper listened on the
stairs.
</p>

<p>
"The man on the right," she whispered, shuddering,
"is Cochlaeus.  The other is the man he was
talking to in Gropper's house.  Why should they
be watching our home?"
</p>

<p>
The answer seemed to come in natural sequence
with the question, for her memory recalled what
Cochlaeus had said concerning the fate of the printer
who should be so daring as to print Tyndale's
translation of the Bible.
</p>

<p>
Surely, oh, surely, her father had nothing to do
with that work?
</p>

<p>
The men passed on.  It was a relief to see them
going; a greater relief still when they had gone out
of sight.  And Margaret put up her lips for Herman's
kiss.  But even while her lips met his she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Herman," she said, keeping her lips near his,
"they have come back."
</p>

<p>
The young man looked up and saw them.  The
men were at the corner of the street, just visible
in the lantern light, and it seemed to him and
Margaret, as they watched, that they were gazing
at the house once more.
</p>

<p>
But what could he do?
</p>

<p>
He was asking that question when the men again
passed out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, beloved," said Margaret, throwing
her arms around her lover's neck, as he gathered
her closer to himself.  A fear had come that
something tragic and terrible might happen before they
met again&mdash;if ever they did meet.  That presentiment
of coming trouble made her kiss Herman as,
in spite of her whole-hearted love, she had never
done before.
</p>

<p>
"You are late, my child, and I was growing
anxious," said her father when she had lifted the
latch and entered the room where he was sitting
before an open book which contained the account
of his sales in the printing-shop.
</p>

<p>
"I have been hindered, but I will tell you all,"
the girl exclaimed, going to his side to give him
the answer from John Cropper.
</p>

<p>
"Father," she went on, when he had made a note
of her message in the book that was in front of him,
"do you know Master William Tyndale?"
</p>

<p>
The printer's face paled at the unexpected question,
and the pen dropped from his fingers on to the
open page.  The impulse came to prevaricate, but
after some hesitation the answer came slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my child; I know him."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know a man named Cochlaeus, father?"
she asked, when that answer came, and almost
before she had ended her question Byrckmann sprang
to his feet, with a cry.
</p>

<p>
"God be our helper!  Why do you mention that
man's name?"
</p>

<p>
His face betrayed the intensity of his fear.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, dear, and I will tell you," said
Margaret, dropping on a stool at the hearth,
where, when he should sit, she could see his
face.
</p>

<p>
The printer sank into his chair, when he had turned
it to face the fire, looking down at his daughter with
eyes that were filled with terror.  She saw that his
body trembled as an aspen leaf shivers on its tree,
when she told him what she had seen and heard in
Cropper's house.  When her story ended he rested
his elbows on his knees and buried his face in his
hands, and for some time not a word was spoken.
Margaret's hand lay gently on his knee, and sitting
thus in silence, wondering, yet almost afraid to
speak, she gazed into the fire, save when for a brief
moment now and again she watched her father
furtively.
</p>

<p>
Horror gathered about her in those waiting
moments, for her imagination revealed some terrible
pictures in the fire.  She saw a dungeon there, and
in it were some dark-robed Familiars.  Around
were all the instruments of torture, and a red fire
glowed in which were thrust the implements that
were to do some deadly work.  And presently into
the chamber came two men, their hands chained,
and about them were four Familiars.  But it was
these two chained ones to whom she looked, for
she knew them.  One was William Tyndale&mdash;the
other was her father!
</p>

<p>
Her father's voice helped her to smother her cry
of anguish at a picture which seemed so real.
</p>

<p>
"My child, if Cochlaeus were to come to this
house it would mean ruin for us all, and death for
me."
</p>

<p>
Her lips parted, but she was speechless.  It
flashed upon her that the printer of Tyndale's
sheets was her own father, and if Cochlaeus came
he would find them in the house, somewhere, she
could not think where; but in that case the terrible
picture in the fire was not imagination, but
something too real&mdash;too fearful&mdash;and the day might not
be far away when her father and William Tyndale
would actually walk into the dungeon to face the
tormentors.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me, my child," said Byrckmann,
standing up and staring before him with a face so
full of pain that she was alarmed more than she
already had been.
</p>

<p>
He said no more, but went out of the room,
carrying the lamp with him.  She followed him
into the workshop where the printing-presses were;
then going to a room beyond, he walked to a corner
where piles of paper stood.  Giving her the lamp to
hold, he cleared a space on the floor, and to her
surprise she saw him go on his knees.  Had trouble
so overwhelmed him that he meant to pray?
</p>

<p>
But it was not that.  He drew a key from his
pocket and inserted it in a hole from which he
carefully scraped the dust.  Standing up, he bade
her drop back to the doorway, and, bending low,
raised a portion of the floor, making it lean back
against one of the printing machines.  What she
saw brought a cry of surprise to her lips, for she
was gazing into a dark cellar.  A printing-press
stood in the centre of the stone floor below, and close
by it was a great pile of paper.
</p>

<p>
Following her father down the ladder, carrying
the lantern with her, she looked around.  Thrust up
against the walls were other piles, and, going to one
of them, she saw that they were printed folios.  She
picked up the top sheet and read it, and trembled,
for it was a printed sheet of a part of the New
Testament in English, which she was able to read; and
now she understood why her father spoke of ruin
being possible.  She was realising the far-reaching
consequences when she recalled what Cochlaeus had
said.
</p>

<p>
She almost whispered her words when she had
looked around to be assured that they were alone.
</p>

<p>
"Father, is it not perilous for these to be here?"
</p>

<p>
She pointed to the pile on which she replaced the
sheet she had been reading.  "I only ask because
of what that heretic hunter said, and especially after
I have seen him and that other man in the street
gazing at our home."
</p>

<p>
There was silence.  No sound came until a few
moments later the cathedral bell boomed out the
hour with slow and heavy strokes.
</p>

<p>
"Can we not destroy all this, father?" Margaret
asked, when the last sound of the bell came; and
she crossed the floor to where her father stood in
dumb perplexity.  She laid her hand on his shoulder
and looked into his face with glistening eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Destroy God's Word, my child?" he asked.
"That were cowardice.  It would be like a man
throwing down his cross because the crowd was
threatening.  The Word of God is far too precious;
but if you are ready to help, we can make these
papers fit for removal, so that if Cochlaeus came he
would not find them."
</p>

<p>
"If I am ready, father?" she asked reproachfully.
"How could you question it?  I am more
than ready.  Tell me what to do."
</p>

<p>
She set the lamp down on the printing-press, and
waited to be told.
</p>

<p>
For long hours, on through the dark night, she
toiled with him, putting the precious sheets in
bundles, and covering them with strong paper,
that none might see their contents.  The great bell
of the cathedral boomed out twelve slow and heavy
strokes at midnight, and the task had barely begun.
They never thought of time, and scarcely heard the
strokes, for here was a matter of life and death&mdash;an
endeavour to hide these folios from the hunters of
heresy, and, as Margaret felt while she toiled on
feverishly, to save her father from the torments of
the Inquisition.
</p>

<p>
The bell boomed out a solitary note and the work
was not yet done.  Again and again Margaret
paused to listen.  She thought she heard footsteps&mdash;the
rattle of steel, the sharp word of command,
and then a noise on the street door; but it was her
fancy, and her father assured her so when she
spoke about it.
</p>

<p>
Again the strokes boomed on the night air&mdash;two.
They came an hour later&mdash;three.  But not until the
fourth stroke sounded and the city settled again into
silence was the work ended.
</p>

<p>
"What next, father?" Margaret asked, sitting
down on one of the bundles, too weary to stand after
the long night of strain.
</p>

<p>
"That, my child, the Lord must decide.  Let us
make sure of His guidance, for everything touching
on our safety lies with Him."
</p>

<p>
The printer went on his knees, and Margaret
knelt beside him on the stones, her hands clasped
and her eyes closed, while her father prayed that the
work of sending forth the Truth for the enlightenment
of men might not be hindered.  Margaret listened
in wonder, for there was not one word in the prayer
for his own escape.  He was centring his thought
on the safety of these precious sheets on which he
had been working night after night for many weeks,
and as well on the safeguarding of the man of God
who dwelt in her lover's home.
</p>

<p>
The day was breaking when they rose from their
knees.  Climbing out of this unsuspected cellar and
lowering the floor into its place again, they piled
great bundles of paper round the shop on that side,
leaving everything as it had been before.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE COMING OF THE GUARD
</h3>

<p>
The long day passed, and every hour was
filled with intolerable anxiety for Margaret.
She went about the household duties in her
home with a heart that was heavy with
dread.  Every unusual sound had menace in it, for
her.  Had anyone noticed her they would have
wondered why, again and again, she glanced around
with startled eyes, while her parted lips went far
to betray her distress.
</p>

<p>
Her mother was ill at the time, and again and
again Margaret had to go into her room to see to
her comfort; but when the girl's hand was on the
latch she was careful to throw aside all traces of
anxiety, and she went in with a loving smile and
a happy-looking face, not wishing to add to her
mother's care or to set her thinking that something
was wrong.  It was a hard task, but her eyes
glanced about the room merrily, and she stood at
the bedside and chatted pleasantly about little
things that made for laughter.
</p>

<p>
But God knew how the poor girl's heart and
mind were on the strain, and how, when she heard
some measured footsteps in the street, she listened
with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, lest
it should be some of the City Guard, coming to the
house to search in her father's printing-shop for
what some esteemed tenfold worse than treachery.
</p>

<p>
Once, while her mother was asking a question as
to some petty household matter, she heard the
sound for which she had been listening ever since
she had got out of bed in the early morning.  She
gave an answer which made her mother wonder
what she was thinking of, and then hurried to the
window and looked into the street below.
</p>

<p>
Her hands clasped in dread, and she almost cried
out in her terror, for the thing had come that might
well mean ruin.  Below were half a score of soldiers
of the City Guard, with their halberds gleaming in
the watery sun, and the soldiers' eyes were
carelessly scanning the houses around them as they
stood at ease, or were nodding to some acquaintance
who went by.  She had seen the men do this many
a time, and thought nothing of it; but now she
gazed into the street with frightened eyes, and her
clasped hands rested on her bosom to still the
beating of her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Father!" she murmured noiselessly, for she
thought of that picture she had seen in the fire.
</p>

<p>
The officer of the Guard was carelessly looking
at some papers in his hand, turning one over the
other, as if searching for one in particular.  Never
had she gazed as she was gazing now, her breath
coming and going in gasps.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you breathing in that way, my dear?"
the sick woman asked, looking at the girl at the
window.
</p>

<p>
"Was I breathing differently than usual, mother?"
Margaret asked, turning for a moment, careful to
hide the look of dread, and with a forced smile for
her mother's sake.  "Perhaps I was!" she added
lightly.  "Ha! there's Targon, the butcher.  I
must go down and give him an order for to-morrow's
dinner."
</p>

<p>
She moved to the bedside, and, bending over
to give her mother a kiss, she hurried down the
stairs.
</p>

<p>
What did it mean?  For when the Captain of
the Guard had found the paper he wanted, and had
thrust the others back into his belt, he moved
straight to her father's door, as if to enter the shop.
As she descended the steps of the staircase at a
dangerous speed her mind was as quick as her feet.
Startling visions of possibilities rose before her.  It
was that horrible picture again which she had seen
in the fire.  There was more in it now than before.
There was the stake, with its flames fanned by the
breeze, and her father chained in the midst of them
all.  There was that wheel of torture on which he
was to be broken.  There was the dark cell, with
its slime, and horrors, and blackness, all made more
intolerable because there would be no more glimpse
of the daylight for him, if they did not decide to
burn him.  Or there might be no death, but the
galley to which her father would be chained, with
his back bared to the sun and wind, while the whip
of the galley captain would come down on the
flesh, and leave its streaks of blood.
</p>

<p>
It was there in those few moments.
</p>

<p>
She stood in the doorway of the parlour, in the
shadow, from whence she could see what was
passing in the shop.
</p>

<p>
The Captain of the Guard was there, and the
paper was in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Master Byrckmann," she heard the soldier
say, with a disconcerting lack of cordiality, "the
Burgomaster bade me bring you this."
</p>

<p>
Almost rudely he tossed the paper on the counter,
among the printed sheets and other things that lay
there.
</p>

<p>
"See to that without fail," he added curtly.
</p>

<p>
Without another word he stamped his way to
the door, and, with a rattle of steel as his armour
moved on his body, strode into the street, and left
the shop door to slam after him.  The noise of the
slamming sounded very much like a death-knell to
Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, father?" she cried, hurrying to the
printer's side behind the counter when a customer
was served, and was gone, and they were alone
together.
</p>

<p>
She glanced into his face, and, although he had
appeared unperturbed while the soldier and the
customer were in the shop, it was white now, and
when her father's fingers were put forward to take
up the paper they trembled so that he could scarcely
close them on it.
</p>

<p>
"Something from the Burgomaster, my dear,"
Byrckmann answered, trying to appear at ease, but
completely failing.
</p>

<p>
He broke the city seal, smoothing out the paper
on the counter.  They read it with their heads
close together, their cheeks almost touching.  It
was written in the ill-formed characters which
were so noticeable in everything which came from
the Chief Magistrate's hand.
</p>

<p>
It told its own story.  Word had reached him
that a notable and troublesome heretic had come
from England, whose name was William Tyndale.
How it had happened no one knew, but this fellow,
so it was said, had contrived to get into the city.
Possibly he had come in disguise, a man with a
godless heart, and a mind bent on spreading
his scandalous heresy.  He was hiding somewhere,
but no one knew where, and was supposed to be
translating the Scriptures into English.  It was
suspected, as well, that, if he had not already done
so, he would be trying to induce one of the printers
to run his wicked sheets through the printing-press.
</p>

<p>
"I charge you, Master Byrckmann, as I am
charging all the printers within my jurisdiction,"
the paper ran, "to abstain from having anything
to do with this scandalous fellow who, like Doctor
Martin Luther, is working out the devil's wicked
will, and seeking to wean away the people from His
Holiness the Pope and Mother Church.
</p>

<p>
"For bethink you, Master Byrckmann, what can
happen more calamitous to the credit of our famous
city than that this man, Tyndale, should be sheltering
in a house inside our walls, and daring, in his
insolence, to interpret Divine Law, the statutes of
our Fathers, and those decrees which have received
the consent of so many ages, in a manner totally at
variance with the opinion of the learned priests of
the Church!  Yet this fellow has dared to do this
thing!  He has done what Luther dared! and now,
like him, he is tampering so wickedly with the Word
of God.
</p>

<p>
"I demand of you, Master Byrckmann, that if
you come across him you shall take his work with
a subtle readiness.  Pretend to applaud his
endeavours.  Make him all sorts of promises.  Make
him believe that it is a joy to you to be of service in
his cause; but when he is gone, send me instant
word as soon as you have traced him to the house
wherein he is lodging."
</p>

<p>
"Father," said Margaret, whose arm stole about
his neck while they still bent over the counter.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her and saw the colour coming back
to her face, and her lips were now relaxed to their
usual softness after this intolerable strain.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, my dear?" Byrckmann asked.
</p>

<p>
"The Captain of the Guard had other papers in
his belt, so he must be going the round of the printers.
Do you not think so?"
</p>

<p>
"That must be it, my child.  I thank God," he
murmured, clasping his hands like one in prayer as
they rested on the counter.  "None knows but God,
and Master Tyndale and you and I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And Herman, father, and his mother," said
Margaret softly.  "They know."
</p>

<p>
"Ah yes!  I had forgotten.  Now may God
send the good man safe deliverance."
</p>

<p>
He unclasped his hands and stood upright, and
gazed out of the window with eyes that gleamed
with tears which blurred the forms of those who
walked along the street.  None of the passers-by
suspected what nearness to tragedy there had been
in the printer's shop.
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me, father," said Margaret, and the printer,
turning, put his arms about her, and kissed her
almost passionately.  He had always loved his
daughter, but here was an even closer bond; something
that was linking them to other things; things
that were sacred, and beyond the matters that
came in the common round of daily life.
</p>

<p>
Margaret went back to her mother, singing softly
as she went from place to place in the bedroom,
putting things right, and making the chamber look
more cosy.  When she moved it was with a tender
grace.  When she spoke it was with a gladness and a
smile that were restful to the sick mother on the bed.
</p>

<p>
Who could wonder?  That string of visions was
passed at all events for the present.  Her father,
so far, was safe.  But at odd times, when she
moved about the house, she stopped to say a
prayer, pleading that the dear Lord would keep
the secret from that ignoble Cochlaeus, and all
others who were scenting heresy, and striving to
find Master Tyndale and all who had dealings with
him.  Their success meant so much.  Ruin for
her father!  Ah!&mdash;and she went pale at the
thought&mdash;ruin for Herman!
</p>

<p>
As the day went on the relief gave place to anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Her heart grew more and more heavy, for after
the first revulsion from that deadly fear her memory
served her with a cruelty that was hard to bear.
It brought back all that happened the night before.
That coming of the man on the stairs of Cropper's
home; the enforced but unintentioned eavesdropping
outside the door on the landing, and
hearing what Cochlaeus knew; and, later still,
the watchers in the street just opposite her father's
house.  It was terrible to contemplate the
possibilities, for who could tell whether that paper from
the Burgomaster was a blind&mdash;something to throw
her father off his guard?  She shivered at the
thought; then she went so hot that she drew her
dainty kerchief from her bosom to wipe the
dampness from her face.
</p>

<p>
A change came over her father which greatly
puzzled her.  She could not understand how he
could move among the workmen, and be so cheerful,
and smile so comfortably at the customers who
bought things over the counter of the shop.  Not
one among them would have suspected that he had
been faced with death, and even now might see
the Captain of the Guard enter, and take him
away.
</p>

<p>
She did what under other circumstances she would
have despised herself for, but she could not help it
now.  She felt she must do it, or she would die of
anxiety.  She stood where she could hear what was
said when all the workmen had gone save Gropper,
who closed the street door, so that no one should
enter the shop, and break in on their conversation
without it being known.
</p>

<p>
"What say you, Gropper, now that you know
as much as I do?" her father asked, when the
foreman stood before him at the counter.
</p>

<p>
"Get Master Tyndale and everything belonging
to him out of the way," came the answer, in decisive
tones.
</p>

<p>
"Out of the way?" the printer interrupted.
"What do you mean by that?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean, get him out of the city; but where, I
cannot say for the moment.  We'll think about it,
Master Byrckmann.  We'll pray over it, and God
will show us which way the path lies," the man
said quietly.
</p>

<p>
He was going to say more, but a customer came
in noisily, and the foreman stood back, and waited
until the man was served and went away.
</p>

<p>
As if she came out of the house casually, Margaret
crossed the shop, and, going to the door, called to
the customer, who was their butcher, and gave
him an order for the next morning.  Her face
was aflame with having played that mean part of
listener, but so much was at stake.  It was a matter
of life or death.  And Herman was involved;
for if Cochlaeus or the Burgomaster found him
harbouring that arch-heretic there was no other
end but death.
</p>

<p>
In her confusion she gave Targon an order which
made the butcher stare at her in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you made a mistake, Mistress Margaret?"
the man asked, wondering at her paleness;
for now her face had changed.
</p>

<p>
"What did I say?" she asked, and when he
repeated the order her face crimsoned.  "It must
be this thunder in the air," she answered, by way
of exculpation, and with an effort she told Targon
what she really required.
</p>

<p>
She wanted to get away, to see Herman and tell
him all she knew.  If she could talk the matter over
with him he might suggest something, and she could
tell her father of the plan.  But she was hindered.
Her father went back to the workshop with Gropper,
and left her to look after the customers, who came
in one after another, some for the merest trifles,
and some on matters of importance.
</p>

<p>
Two or three stopped to talk of what was being
said in the city.  First and foremost Cochlaeus
was there, and that suggested heresy.  Then a
special body of the Guard had been out most of the
day, halting at every printer's shop to leave a letter
which, of course, was from the Burgomaster.  But
what was of more importance still was this&mdash;that
it was declared that William Tyndale was
somewhere in the city, and that to-morrow a great
reward was to be offered as the price upon his
head, and a price, also, on the head of any who
harboured him.
</p>

<p>
Margaret thought she would choke when they
talked on in that strain, little knowing what she
knew, and what it meant to her beloved if the reward
were to be claimed.  Her Herman! the man who
was all the world to her!  Once again, while the
customers were standing at the counter, talking
on in that strain, she did not see them, for she was
gazing afresh at that picture in the fire, and she
shuddered because it seemed so real that her father
and Herman alike were being broken on the wheel.
</p>

<p>
One by one the customers dropped off, and then
none came at all, and the shop was empty when her
father came in with a sealed letter in his hand,
which trembled as he held it out to her.
</p>

<p>
"Take this to Master Tyndale," he whispered.
"Put it into your bosom so that none may see it,
and wait to hear what he says concerning it.  Go
warily.  But there!  None will suspect, because
Herman and you are shortly to be wedded."
</p>

<p>
She went to her room for her cloak and hood, and
standing at the window she gazed into the street,
which was shadowing into dark twilight, earlier
than usual because it was raining, and black clouds
were sweeping up from the river and spreading over
the city.  Preparing for bad weather, she went out
into the street, after first showing her father where
she had hidden the letter.
</p>

<p>
The rain was coming down steadily, but presently
it came pelting, and the wind rushing along between
the houses of the narrow streets blew into her face.
But she scarcely noticed it.  She was absorbed
with the thought that she was going to see Herman,
to whom she would tell all she knew.  Perhaps he
would propose that William Tyndale should get
away at once, lest to-morrow should be too late.
</p>

<p>
The rain came down so heavily that the streets
were almost empty, although it was not late.  It
was one of those storms which no one would face
if it could be avoided.
</p>

<p>
At the corner of the street in which Herman lived
she paused, not for the wind, although it was
sweeping along with the force of a tempest now, but
because of what was happening.  Out of a narrow
passage, where some wayfarers sheltered, there
swung out, two by two, some of the City Guard,
and at their head the Captain who had left the
Burgomaster's letter with her father.
</p>

<p>
If they had turned her way she would have been
relieved, and the fear would have passed which
shook her terribly; but they went the other way.
Was it possible that they were going to Herman's
home?
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE MAN IN THE ARCHWAY
</h3>

<p>
Margaret hurried into the archway, where
others were sheltering, and a man who
was standing near shifted to make room
for her.  As she stepped in the raindrops
came down so heavily that they leapt up from the
stones.  The water ran from the edge of her hood
in little streams which trickled down her face;
but it was relief rather than otherwise, for the
coolness revived her.
</p>

<p>
Heavily as the rain was pouring, she bent forward
to see whether the Guard were going to Herman's
house, but the man, putting a hand on her shoulder,
drew her back.  They were alone now, for the other
people, believing that the rain had set in for the
night, hurried away.
</p>

<p>
"The water is falling down on you, mistress," he
said, civilly enough; and he pointed to the gargoyle
over the archway, where the water came as from a
pipe, and spread out like a fan.
</p>

<p>
"I was anxious to see where the Guard were
going in all this rain," she explained, looking round
at him; and the man, catching a glimpse of her
face by the light of a lamp which a stableman had
just hung up in the arch, saw the look of dread upon it.
</p>

<p>
"Stand here, then, and you will not get that
shower bath," said the stranger, drawing her forward
almost roughly, although he had no thought of
rudeness.  He wondered whether this dainty little
damsel, whose pretty face looked so startled, had any
reason to dread the City Guard.
</p>

<p>
Margaret gazed from her new standing-place
unrestrainedly, and with her eyes glued on that
moving company of men, she noted every step they
took.  It appeared to her, in her anxiety, that
their movements were relentless.  They were even
cruel, she thought.  They passed the greater
buildings, looking neither to right nor left, each man
resting his chin tightly down on his muffling collar,
so that the water which streamed from his helmet
should not find its way down his neck.
</p>

<p>
Even that indifference to what was on either side
of the soldiers of the Guard seemed sinister to
Margaret.  It left everything in such uncertainty.
The shock would be so much greater if, after all, the
Captain called a halt at Herman's door.
</p>

<p>
She wished she could see the officer who showed
the way, but she could only obtain an occasional
glance at the streaming helmet whenever he passed
a swinging lantern.  She thought that if she could
see him she might judge his purpose by his bearing,
whether he meant to pass on or slow down to
a pace which would enable him to find the house.
</p>

<p>
The man in the archway became infected with
her eagerness, for he, too, stared down the street
despite the pouring of the water from the ugly
gargoyle's mouth.  But she was scarcely aware of
his presence.  At another time she would have
stood out in the drenching rain, in the midst of it,
where it poured its heaviest, rather than trust
herself in the gloomy archway with an unknown
stranger whose presence might well be intolerable
to a defenceless girl.  But her mind was altogether
on Herman, and all other considerations receded.
The man near by was an incident in her night's
experiences, while the absorbing thought was the
disastrous consequences if the Guard went to
Herman's house and found Master William Tyndale
there!
</p>

<p>
The Guard moved on and on, going more and
more slowly, she thought.  Were they doing it
deliberately so that the Captain might not miss her
lover's home?  The thought made her feel sick
at heart, and for a moment she reeled.  She would
have fallen had not the man put out his hand and
caught at her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Dear heart!" he muttered.  "I know it all.
They stopped at my door one night&mdash;just such a
night as this!"
</p>

<p>
The words came unexpectedly, and Margaret
turned quickly, looking into his face inquiringly,
for she could not miss the pain that was in that
almost whispered exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis all right, little one," the man said
tremulously.  "The memory came like a flood upon me,
of a night like this, when a City Guard came to my
door and took away my darling, just such a girl as
yourself."
</p>

<p>
He held his hands to his face for a few moments,
and his body shook with sobs, as it can only do
with a strong man in his agony.
</p>

<p>
Margaret gazed at him.  He spoke with a foreign
accent, and something reminded her of Master
Tyndale.
</p>

<p>
Brushing his hands across his face, and without
another word, the man stepped to and fro in the
narrow archway, and then went into the storm and
walked away with bent head, while the pelting rain
beat on him.  Margaret marked how his hands
clenched while he passed along in a direction opposite
to that which the armed Guard had taken.
</p>

<p>
His going after those unexpected words made her
heart palpitate the more, for if the Guard took that
man's daughter, would they hesitate to take a man,
and that man her lover?
</p>

<p>
"No!  They would not!"
</p>

<p>
The words were cried out on the night, but the
wind beat them down, and perhaps no one heard
them.
</p>

<p>
The thought that obsessed Margaret was that the
Guard were going for Herman.  They must have
discovered that it was Tyndale whom he had carried
up the steps at the Water-Gate.  It must be so!
Five hundred golden pieces were to be the reward
of the man or men who found him who harboured
William Tyndale.  Five hundred!  It meant wealth.
Who would care for rain, or pity, when so much
gold was to be had?
</p>

<p>
Lower down the street, which was a very long
one, there was a bend, and from the archway
Margaret could not see Herman's house.  She must
see for herself whether the Guard passed it by,
in spite of the pelting rain and the boisterous
wind.
</p>

<p>
She left the archway and ran along the causeway
with a light, swift tread, careless as to the beating of
her soddened dress against her knees.  Herman's
home lay beyond the bend, but not very far, and
they must be very near to it by this time.  In her
haste she did not see a man standing in the way,
with his arms outstretched to stop her.
</p>

<p>
"My dainty darling!" he cried drunkenly, but
she endeavoured to evade him.  She failed, and his
arms closed about her, and he drew her to him and
set his wet and hairy cheek against hers.
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me, my sweet!" he exclaimed; but her
courage served her, and, losing sight of the Guard,
she drew up her hands and rained her blows on his
face.  She hammered at him with her small fists,
beating at his eyes until he was fain to let her go
to save himself.
</p>

<p>
"The vicious little minx!" he cried, staggering,
and tumbling into the gutter, as she darted away.
</p>

<p>
She was soon close up to the Guard, but was careful
to keep well out of sight, walking as near to the
doors of the houses as the projecting steps would
allow.  Not far away was Herman's home.  She
saw it, and wondered what would happen, whether
the soldiers would halt there.
</p>

<p>
Her heart almost stood still, and she sank on a
doorstep near by, for the Guard had halted opposite
Herman's door.  The thought of the inevitable
discovery, now, was overwhelming.  There was no
hiding-place there, for Herman had never spoken of
one.  And William Tyndale was in that house!
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were riveted on the men whose halting
spelt ruin to her own hopes, to her lover's destiny,
and to William Tyndale's splendid endeavours
to set the Truth before the world.  Ruin!  Yes,
nothing less than that!
</p>

<p>
She saw the men turn half-way round so that
they formed a double line in the middle of the road,
the ends of their halberds resting on the ground,
and the steel end of each gleaming in the lantern
rays.
</p>

<p>
The Captain of the Guard went to the door which
she prayed he might pass by&mdash;to Herman's!  He
mounted the steps&mdash;one, two, three!  There could
be no mistake.  It was Herman's home, for, as she
knew, and he had often boasted, no other house in
that street had that number of steps.  There were
houses with four, with two, with one, with none, but
only Herman's had three.
</p>

<p>
The soldier struck on the door with his sword
handle, and the sounding blows reached her ears,
loud, even in the swishing rain.
</p>

<p>
No answer came, and the summons was repeated.
</p>

<p>
The heavy shutter opened at one of the windows,
and a head appeared, but it was too dark to see
whose it was.
</p>

<p>
"What is your will?" came the question, and
Margaret's heart leapt at the sound of Herman's
voice.
</p>

<p>
"I must come in to search your house, Master
Bengel."
</p>

<p>
"To search my house?" interrupted Herman,
who did not betray any perturbation in his voice in
spite of the sight of a double row of soldiers in the
street.  "For what?  For whom?"
</p>

<p>
"For one named William Tyndale," answered
the Captain, who was taken by surprise at this show
of ease&mdash;the absence of confusion and fear.
</p>

<p>
Margaret could scarce believe her ears when a
laugh came through the rain; a laugh she would
have known if all the men in the city had been
there.
</p>

<p>
"For one named William Tyndale?" Herman
cried, after the laugh, and in such a tone of
incredulity that Margaret was amazed at his courage,
and his ease in carrying it, when he must have
known that he was faced with the prospect of the
wheel, or prison, or the stake, with torture
preceding it.  "Who told you such a mad thing that
the Englishman should be here in my house, of all
houses in the city?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that," was the impatient answer.
"Open this door, and let me enter."
</p>

<p>
"I protest that you will find no William Tyndale
here, if you mean the so-called Reformer who, they
say, came over from England some time since," said
Herman, as he leisurely pulled the shutter into its
place.
</p>

<p>
It astonished Margaret that he should play this
part; and yet she admired his effrontery, and was
taken with his boldness in meeting the inevitable
disaster.  That inevitable thing was ruin.  It was
death!  But her heart bounded with a certain
pride at her lover's fortitude.  Better die a bold
man than a craven.  And he was bound to die,
because William Tyndale was in the house!
</p>

<p>
She heard the bolt being drawn.  She heard the
clinking of the falling chain.  She caught the sound
of the screaming key in the lock, and then the dull
grumble of the opening door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," she heard Herman say in an easy tone.
</p>

<p>
The Captain called to three men to step forward,
and the four soldiers entered the house.
</p>

<p>
Margaret asked herself the question&mdash;What
should she do?  But what was it possible to do?
Her presence or her absence could in no way serve
Herman; and yet she wanted to be near him in his
trouble, to throw her arms about him ere they took
him away to those horrible dungeons in the Holy
House&mdash;the headquarters of the Inquisition&mdash;and
whisper in his ear that whatever came she was his,
for life or for death, just as God willed.
</p>

<p>
The thought decided her.  She sprang up from
the step on which she had been sitting in the shadow,
around which, unknown to her, the water had
gathered and soaked into her dress, and hurried
across the road.  Disregarding the soldiers lined up
in the middle of the street, standing still in the
pelting rain, she was moving up the steps, feeling
the water squashing in her shoes as she
moved.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers inside the house were standing about;
one in the front room with the Captain&mdash;in the
very place where she had last spoken to William
Tyndale&mdash;and two others near the foot of the
staircase, and in such a position as to look up the
stairs, or into the room where Herman's mother
usually sat.
</p>

<p>
Margaret's lips parted in wonder, for Mistress
Bengel, who was there, was perfectly self-possessed,
her hands idle, it is true, and her usual sewing lying
untouched on the table.  Whether her ease was
real or assumed it was difficult to say, but Margaret
was puzzled.
</p>

<p>
When the girl entered the room, white faced and
startled, she looked up and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I have visitors, my dear," she said, in her
pleasant way.
</p>

<p>
It was mysterious.  Was William Tyndale gone
away from the house, so that Herman and his
mother could afford to be at ease even with the
Captain of the Guard paying this unwelcome visit?
Or&mdash;and the thought came over her with startling
force&mdash;was the poor man dead, and, being so, was it
of no consequence if the soldier should find his dead
body lying in his bedroom?
</p>

<p>
But dead!
</p>

<p>
The bare thought of it was a troubling one; for
a few hours before she had seen the dear man in the
attitude of prayer, with his hands clasped, his face
full of fervent entreaty, and she had heard him
plead in an earnestness that was indescribable:
</p>

<p>
"Spare me, O God, until my work is ended."
</p>

<p>
The prayer was surely heard; but had it been
answered?  Or was Tyndale dead after all, before
his work was done?  Was it to be as she had heard
her father say, more than once, that God buries His
workmen, but carries on His work?
</p>

<p>
From where she stood, undecided as to what she
should do&mdash;whether to go into the room and stay
with Mistress Bengel, or follow her lover with her
watchful eye, and perhaps be of some sort of service,
if the opportunity came&mdash;she could hear Herman's
voice.  Shifting a little, she saw what was going
on, since the door was partly open.  Herman was
holding a lighted lamp in one hand, and making
a gesture with the other; but his face bore no
trace of anxiety as to the issue of the search.
</p>

<p>
"The room is at your service, Captain Berndorf,
but there is no William Tyndale in it.  Nor is he
anywhere in the house."
</p>

<p>
The soldier was looking round searchingly.
Margaret marked his eager glances, and saw how he
passed round the room.  He opened a cupboard,
and ran his hand round the sides; he shifted pieces
of furniture, and pulled down some of the pictures
if they suggested space sufficient for a man to go
into hiding.
</p>

<p>
The search in that room was a vain one.
</p>

<p>
The Captain, with the soldier, came out of it, and
not seeing Margaret he brushed against her.  When
he saw her he was not surprised at the startled look
on her face, for such looks were usual in his
experience, when he went hunting for rogues and
rascals, and honest men and women whose crime
was heresy.  What was more, he knew her to be
Herman Bengal's sweetheart, so that he merely
asked her pardon for blundering up against her, and
did not inquire why she should be in the house.  It
seemed to him the most natural thing in all the
world that she should be there, and for a moment
a sympathetic thought came that the poor girl
should witness the arrest of her lover.
</p>

<p>
"I must go through the house," the Captain
exclaimed, turning his back on Margaret, but he had
more to say, which plainly showed that he had no
sense of certainty as to this errand on which he had
come.
</p>

<p>
"Why it should be suggested that a fellow of
Tyndale's stamp should be lodging under your roof,"
he went on, "I cannot imagine.  It was mentioned,
probably, by someone who owed you a grudge.
Still, here's my warrant to search for the man, and
I may not leave you until I have thoroughly
satisfied myself that he is not here."
</p>

<p>
He walked into the room where Herman's mother
sat, and Margaret entered that one where the
search had been just made.  The lamp stood on the
sconce, and she looked around.  There was nothing
on the table where Tyndale had so often sat to
write.  Nothing was in the place to suggest his
presence; not a sheet of paper, no clothing, no
traveller's wallet, nothing that could in any way be
connected with the stranger whom she and Herman
had brought within the city.
</p>

<p>
Would Master Tyndale be in hiding elsewhere in
the house?  There lay the question, the tarrying of
the answer adding to her heart-beats and her
despair.  This inexplicable indifference on Herman's
and his mother's part would go dead against
them when discovery came.
</p>

<p>
She went sick with dread.  Her knees so trembled
that she sank into a chair close by, regardless of the
soddened clothes which clung to her.  She could
only bury her face in her hands, and hope, and pray.
There was plenty of scope for prayer; so little for
hope.
</p>

<p>
When she felt she could stand again and move
about, feeble compared with the sound of loud beating
in her heart, she heard the Captain's voice once more.
</p>

<p>
"He is not here; but he may be upstairs.  Men,
see that none pass you to go into the street.  I will
go up and make sure for myself."
</p>

<p>
He began the tramp up the stairs while he was
speaking, and other heavy footsteps followed his.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE SEARCH
</h3>

<p>
Margaret's heart quailed when she hurried
out of the room and followed the men up
the stairs.  Now, for a certainty, Herman's
protégé would fall into the hands of his
enemies, and escape seemed impossible.  Her pulse
beat high, and despair swept over her, to think how
she was to witness the undoing of one who was
striving for the triumph of the right.
</p>

<p>
To be caught in a trap like a rat!  It was unbearable
to think of.
</p>

<p>
The dulled sound of the footsteps on the carpeted
boards of the stairs seemed to call up a vision of a
scene which would ere long be real&mdash;the vision of a
prisoner on his trial; condemned in effect by his
judges before he had made his defence, just because
he was William Tyndale.  And then the attitude of
the crowd that thronged the market-place where
the stake was standing, and Tyndale chained to it.
She could imagine it all, and she could almost hear
the babel of execration against him.
</p>

<p>
To think of it!  A man of such noble mien to be
browbeaten and battered by the screaming mob,
cursed, reviled, mud-covered.  She shuddered at
the thought, and while the impulse came to follow
the others up the stairs, she hid her face while doing
so, and sobbed.
</p>

<p>
She stood at the top of the stairs and looked
around.  Here, on her right hand, was the room
into which Herman carried the tired stranger that
night they brought him into the city.  On the left
was Herman's chamber.  Just beyond it, again,
was his mother's.  Master Tyndale must be in one
of them.
</p>

<p>
Captain Berndorf went into Herman's room,
followed by the others, and in a few moments
Margaret heard the soldier say roughly:
</p>

<p>
"Are you here?  Come out of it, if you are!"
</p>

<p>
Resistance would be unavailing, for the Captain's
sword was drawn and ready, gleaming in the lamp-light.
</p>

<p>
Margaret went into Tyndale's chamber.  It was
lighted by the lantern in the street, for the rays
came through the rain-splashed window, and as she
stepped in she almost expected to see him sitting
somewhere, or lying on the bed, waiting for the
inevitable.  Yet, when she stood well within the place
there was a sense of emptiness.  William Tyndale
was neither in the bed, nor at the table near the
window.
</p>

<p>
Was he really gone?
</p>

<p>
While her keen eyes ranged around she saw a
square of whiteness on the floor, by the table, and
went to it quickly, with an instinctive feeling
that it was something which would betray Tyndale,
or Herman.  When she bent down and caught it up
she knew that it was a printed sheet.  Under it lay
another; under that, again, a third.  By the dim
light she saw that they were printed folios, and one
glance was sufficient to show her that they were
proofs of the New Testament, such as she had seen
in her father's hidden cellar.
</p>

<p>
She glanced towards the door, wondering whether
the soldiers were there, and had seen that she had
some papers in her hand, but the doorway was
clear.  Bending her head a little, she saw that the
passage was empty.  The men were still in Herman's
room.
</p>

<p>
She thought of the way out of this very real
danger with her swift woman wit, and hastily
unbuttoning her dress, she pushed the sheets into her
bosom.  It was nothing that they were crumpled.
What were three sheets of printed paper compared
to the lives of two men?
</p>

<p>
To her, as she thrust them in, the papers seemed
to make enough noise to be heard all over the
house, for they crinkled in her hands, and the
dampness came on her face lest she had been heard, and
they should ask her what she had been doing.
</p>

<p>
While she was rapidly buttoning her dress she
turned her face to the window, where the rain came
against the glass in heavy gusts, just as the wind
drove it.  Below were the soldiers of the City Guard,
as when she saw them last, two lines of silent,
unmoving men, with their halberds gleaming.
</p>

<p>
The hope sprang in her heart that William
Tyndale was really gone.  He was not in Herman's
room, or they would have found him.  They were
now going into Mistress Bengel's bedroom, and
would they find him there?  If not, he could not
be in the house, for he was not in this chamber.  Her
woman mind showed her what a man might not
have noticed.  The bed was not made as if waiting
for a sleeper.  It was surprising.  Herman's mother
had taken away the sheets from the bed, and it
looked as though the room had not been used for a
long time past.
</p>

<p>
Margaret centred her attention on what might be
taking place in that bedroom, and because the
suspense was more than she could endure, she went
to see what they were doing.
</p>

<p>
The men were there&mdash;the three; and it was a
strange scene on which she gazed.  Herman was
standing aside, his back to the window, where he
could see everything, and Margaret wondered at the
expression on his face.  It was something like
injured innocence, and, painful though the tension
was, she could not repress a smile when she
saw him watching with the air of a person
subjected to the ignominy of suspicion, and to have
his home invaded for the search of a man who was
not there.
</p>

<p>
The Captain had his sword drawn, and was walking
round the room, looking into the cupboard, and
under the bed, and behind the dresses which hung in
a screened-off corner.  In all reality serious,
disastrous in its promise, it yet appeared ludicrous and
undignified.
</p>

<p>
The man-at-arms was standing apart, and the
look on his face when he glanced towards Herman
intimated that he thought this a fool's errand, on
which they had been sent by some mischief-loving
fellow who wanted to hoax the City Guard.  And
on such a night!  Of late they had been brought
away from the comfortable guard-room for many a
fruitless hunt for this fellow, Tyndale, and this was
all of a piece with the past experience.
</p>

<p>
The search was fruitless, but the Captain was
suspicious of a hiding-place.  Going to the walls,
and bidding the soldier do the same, he began to
beat the handle of his sword against the walls.
First resting his halberd in one corner of the room,
the man drew a dagger from his belt and did as his
Captain did.  He banged on the wall until the dust
began to fly, and the plaster began to drop in
flakes upon the floor.  William Tyndale was too
big a prize to lose for the sake of a few bits of mortar.
They were sounding for some hollow place where a
man might hide.
</p>

<p>
"You need not spoil my home like that!" a
woman's voice came unexpectedly, and Herman's
mother pushed past Margaret into the room, and
laid her hand on the soldier's wrist, speaking with
some asperity.  "I shall appeal to the Burgomaster,
and require him to pay for the repair of this wanton
damage."
</p>

<p>
She wrenched the dagger from the man's hand,
and held it out for the Captain to see.  Her eyes
were on a picture through which the fellow had
driven his weapon, a picture which had been her
dead husband's handiwork in his hours of leisure.
</p>

<p>
"Is that how you come to an honest woman's
house?" she cried, swinging round to face the
astonished soldier, her eyes flashing, and her bosom
heaving while she thought of this wilful damage done,
when a hand put out to remove the picture would
have prevented its ruin.  "I will go to the
Burgomaster even now!" she exclaimed, taking down a
heavy cloak from a nail in the corner, and throwing
it about her shoulders, with the dagger still in her
hand while she began to tie the cord at her throat.
</p>

<p>
The Captain had turned to look at her, the point
of his sword held downwards.  He saw the damage
that was done, and realised the reasonableness of
the woman's resentment.
</p>

<p>
"You were over-rough," he exclaimed, looking
at the picture.  "But, on the other hand, since we
were, told that Master Tyndale would be found here
we must needs miss nothing in our attempt to
discover his whereabouts."
</p>

<p>
"His whereabouts?" cried Herman's mother,
usually so gentle, rarely other than placid, but now
roused by the roughness shown towards what to her
had such holy associations.  "Find the man if he
is here; but neither you nor that fellow there shall
damage what is precious to me, since it was my
dead husband's work, finished but three days before
he died!"
</p>

<p>
She sat on the bed, and, burying her face in her
hands, wept, and the two men could do no other
than look on her in concern as her sobs shook her.
Margaret stepped forward like Herman, and sought
to comfort her, but the girl's face went hot when
she heard the paper in her bosom crinkle as she put
her arms about the weeping woman.
</p>

<p>
The men stole away into the other room, carrying
the lamp with them, leaving the others in the
darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any danger, Herman?" Margaret
asked, drawing her face away from his mother's,
which was wet with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Not unless they find Tyndale, and they won't
do that," said Herman confidently.
</p>

<p>
Again they heard the sound of shifting furniture,
the slam of a cupboard door, the tapping of walls,
but less roughly; and, after a while, the soldiers
stood in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"It is as it has been frequently of late," said the
Captain, almost angrily.  "We are being fooled
by someone, and could I but lay hands on the
miscreant who sends us on such errands, I would
wring his neck!"
</p>

<p>
He turned to go away, but paused.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, mistress, the picture was damaged.
Send it to Josef Amon, the picture dealer, and tell
him to put it to rights at my charges."
</p>

<p>
He moved away, and tramped down the stairs.
To make quite sure that they were not deceived, he
and the man with him, and the soldiers who waited
below with their feet in a pool of water which had
dripped from their clothing, passed through the
lower room to the yard, tapping wherever they went.
</p>

<p>
They were absolutely baffled, for they found
nothing which betrayed the presence of the man
they sought, and on whose head there was so big
a price.
</p>

<p>
The Captain's voice travelled up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, mistress.  Send the picture to
Josef Amon."
</p>

<p>
The street door slammed.  A word of command
was heard outside, made tremulous by the gusty
wind, and a tramp of soldiers followed, sounded
less and less, and before long was no more heard.
</p>

<p>
Herman had gone to the window which looked
into the street, but when he returned the candle
showed a laughing face.  His eyes danced.  His
whole frame shook.  Laughter conquered him so
absolutely that he had to bury his face in the
pillow to deaden the sound, lest someone might
overhear his boisterous mirth.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, mother," he said, in little bursts,
when it was possible to find speech at all.  "To
think how we did them!  Oh, to think of it!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed the more, holding his sides because
of the pain.
</p>

<p>
It was then that his mother saw how wet Margaret
was, and she stood up, in concern, wiping her eyes
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"My child, you are soaking.  Herman, go downstairs,
and I will put this poor girl into some dry
clothes, else she will be chilled to the bone, and ill
may come of it."
</p>

<p>
Herman was serious in an instant, and went
away, and in less than half an hour Margaret
came down with such clothes as Mistress Bengel
could find.  Then she told her business.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Master Tyndale?  Has he left the
city?" she asked, and set the soddened note her
father sent by her on the table.  It was so limp that
the writing on its cover was scarcely readable.
</p>

<p>
Herman bent down and kissed the puzzled-looking
face, and hugged her fondly, laughing the while.
</p>

<p>
"Is he gone out of the city?" she asked, because
her question had not been answered.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me, little woman," said her lover;
and, putting his arm about her, he led her into the
front room.
</p>

<p>
Moving the table when he had made sure that
the shutters were safely closed, and the window so
heavily curtained that no one could look in from
the street, Herman cleared the centre of the floor,
removed the carpet, and tossed it in a heap into one
of the corners.
</p>

<p>
"Just a word, little one," he said, before he did
more; and he sat down while he spoke, the better
to see his darling's face.  "I never told you, but
years ago my father made a discovery when he was
digging for a safe place in which to hide what bit of
money he had, in case of war, and he came across
something.  You shall see it."
</p>

<p>
He went on his knees, smiling when he saw
Margaret's wide-open eyes.  Taking the knife from
his belt, he drove the blade deeply into one of the
boards, and using it as a handle moved the board
aside.  He moved the next with his hand, a third,
and another also.  Asking for a lamp, he held it
over an open space, and looking into the blackness
Margaret exclaimed in surprise.
</p>

<p>
At her feet were some rough, wooden steps, leading
into what seemed to her a deep well, the bottom of
which was not visible.  Herman put a foot on the
topmost step, and descended a little space, when he
asked for the lamp.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me," he said, as she handed it to
him, and Margaret followed without hesitation.
Reaching the bottom, step, she found herself in a
chamber about ten feet long, six feet wide, or
thereabouts, and rather more in height.  At the farther
corner was a spiral staircase, and when Herman
went down with the lamp, and she followed, she
came to another room.
</p>

<p>
Herman saw her bewildered looks, and explained.
</p>

<p>
"My father thought it was a stronghold for
heretics when, a century ago, persecution was
keener even than now.  There were tokens of it in
abundance; but never mind that at present.  I'm
going to let you into the secret of Master Tyndale's
strange disappearance."
</p>

<p>
He cried, but not loudly, and to his call there was
a hollow return of the sound.
</p>

<p>
"Master Tyndale!" he cried again.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?" was the response.
</p>

<p>
"It is I.  Herman Bengel."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
THE PASSAGE
</h3>

<p>
Margaret gazed into the darkened space,
and listened, with increasing wonder.
</p>

<p>
"That was Master Tyndale's voice," she
whispered, half frightened, while she gripped
Herman's hand tightly.
</p>

<p>
"It was.  I put him down here because I chanced
to hear that Cochlaeus had been suggesting that he
was lodging with us.  I told the good man what I
had heard, and proposed that he should go into
hiding, and he did not hesitate, for he guessed how
big and terrible was the net which had been cast for
him.  When he had gathered in his arms all that
was most precious to him, his Bible and his papers,
he followed me to this dark place without any
demur."
</p>

<p>
Herman drew the girl aside a little, and pointed
into the darkness.  From where she then stood she
saw a light some distance away.  Then she saw a
man moving towards her, and carrying a lamp in his
hand.  When he drew nearer she saw a face; and
the nearer it came, the more plainly did she see it.
It was so close at last that she recognised the man to
whom she was desirous of giving her father's letter.
</p>

<p>
"Master Tyndale!" she exclaimed, with bated
breath, going forward to meet him with
outstretched hands.
</p>

<p>
But something like revulsion came.  Her heart
had been crowded out with anxiety all that day,
and during the night which preceded it she had
slept but little, because of the many hours in which
she and her father had been packing those
incriminating sheets which meant so much.  Then had
come the journey through the rain-driven streets,
and the anxious waiting in the archway, watching
the passing of the City Guard.  Her hopes had
scarcely any being.  Her fears were dominant.  It
was a wear on the mind, and to crown it all was the
tension while the house was being searched.
</p>

<p>
It was more than she could bear.  The man who
approached her seemed to sway.  She felt that the
place where they were standing was closing in on
her.  The floor appeared to ascend, and the roof to
sink upon her.  Then all was blank.
</p>

<p>
Herman saw her swaying and caught her in his
arms before she fell.
</p>

<p>
"My darling!" he whispered, kissing her white
face and her lips and her closed eyes.  "What is
wrong?" he asked, holding her to him, and full
of fear when he found that she took no notice of
him.
</p>

<p>
"I will carry her to my mother," he exclaimed,
taking her bodily into his arms, and turning back
to the spiral staircase.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, bring her to my chamber, my son," said
Tyndale, who took both lamps and led the way,
while Herman followed with Margaret.
</p>

<p>
How long she lay on the rude bed she did not
know, but when she opened her eyes, Herman's
mother was kneeling by her side, doing what she
could for her restoration.
</p>

<p>
"Now, dear heart, take it quietly," the motherly
woman said tenderly.  "We are safe here.  Give
your message, and Herman shall presently take you
home."
</p>

<p>
The words were reassuring, and presently she sat
on the edge of the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Master Tyndale," she said, one hand holding the
woman's, and drawing the crumpled papers from
her bosom with the other, "I found these in your
room when Captain Berndorf was searching the
house for you."
</p>

<p>
She held the sheets towards Tyndale, but a cry
of dismay escaped not him alone, but the others.
Their faces paled, and Tyndale, calm though he
was, with deadly danger circumscribing him,
trembled.  For a few moments he was dumb, but
at last he spoke tremulously.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  If these had fallen into the Captain's
hands, of what avail my hiding in this dark place?
And what of the danger to my friends?"
</p>

<p>
His hand shook while it rested on Herman's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I should never have forgiven myself," he
muttered.  "Never!  To have brought sorrow to
a home where I have received such unstinted
kindness!  But there," he added solemnly, "so much
the greater reason for thanking God!"
</p>

<p>
Margaret drew the soddened letter from her bosom.
</p>

<p>
"My father sent me with this, Master Tyndale."
</p>

<p>
Tyndale took it from her, and sitting at the table,
he broke the covering and smoothed out the damp
sheet, laying it flat on the table.  The others
watched him while he read, and saw how, when he
came to the "end, his fingers closed over the written
sheet convulsively.
</p>

<p>
"God's will be done," he exclaimed, with his
head bowed low.  The anguish of the tone betrayed
the intensity of his suffering.  He looked up
presently, and saw the faces of his companions, and
read in them how they anticipated the worst, if
deliverance did not come soon.
</p>

<p>
"It will all come right in time, my friends," he
said quietly, and his eyes and face glowed with
confidence.  "Are we not in the hands of God?
We are always safe under His guidance.  I wronged
the Heavenly Father when I said that all things
were against me.  There is surely some blessing in
our reverses."
</p>

<p>
He read the letter through again with greater
deliberation; then, laying it on the table, he sat
back in his chair, with his head bowed down and
his thin hands folded.
</p>

<p>
"Your father bids me leave the city to-night,"
he exclaimed presently, looking at Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"To-night?" she cried.  Her eyes were fixed
on him as on one who was set an impossible task.
"Where would you go?"
</p>

<p>
She came to his side, and her hand rested on his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I will go to the city where Martin Luther is,
and where he played his part so nobly four years
ago."
</p>

<p>
He stood up and began to pack his papers, the
precious sheets on which he had spent his fine
scholarship with such unremitting patience and
splendid zeal.  Apparently he did not realise the
futility of it, as the others round him did.  How
could he think to get away from the city now that
Cochlaeus had set the hunters on the move?  It
seemed to Margaret and the others, while they
watched in silence, that William Tyndale was like a
rat in a trap; not safe behind the iron bars, but
certain to be routed out and snapped at by the
sharp teeth of the dog the moment he left the cage.
</p>

<p>
Their minds were active as to the possibilities.
Suppose Tyndale ventured into the streets and
made his way towards the quay, would he not
meet someone who would challenge him, since it
was posted up all through Cologne that a heavy
price was on his head?  Heavy if he were brought
in dead; heavier still if alive, so that he should be
dealt with by the tormentors.  If he got as far as
the ramparts would he be likely to find the sentry
asleep?  The shuffling gait of the scholar, so
Margaret thought, would betray him.  While he
moved he would run the gauntlet of a dozen who
would know him for a stranger, dark though it
would be in the stormy night.  Even on the quay,
were he to get so far, who could suppose that he
could slip on board any of the river-craft unseen?
Captain Berndorf and his men had marched away
from the house in that direction, and were possibly
searching the ships.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot go to-night, Master Tyndale," said
Herman presently.  "Lie here in peace, and be
content where you are safe, where no one could
suspect your presence; and I will watch for an
opportunity."
</p>

<p>
The younger man spoke with an assurance he did
not feel.  Already he looked on his protégé as a
man within the toils&mdash;himself scarcely less so.  But
why display any doubt when a way, in God's mercy,
might open?
</p>

<p>
Tyndale realised the reasonableness of Herman's
words, and, desisting from his eager task, he sat at
the table, drawing away from the others the printed
sheets which Margaret had saved from the eyes of
the soldiers.  He read some portion of them aloud
while the others sat and listened.  Then came the
kneeling moments, when he committed himself and
his companions to the Almighty hands.  Still more
urgent was his entreaty that he might be spared to
complete his task of making God's Word ready for
the multitude to read.
</p>

<p>
When the prayer was ended and the little
company stood again, Margaret wondered at Herman's
face.  His eyes were bright.  His face expectant.
Going to the table, he took the lamp, and was about
to walk away; but he paused.
</p>

<p>
"Master Tyndale, while you were praying," he
exclaimed, "something came to my mind, and now
I feel sure that God will answer that petition of
yours."
</p>

<p>
They looked at him in wonder.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, my son?" asked Tyndale.
</p>

<p>
"That God may show us a way out of the city,
which will spell safety for you.  Margaret, come with
me.  Mother, stay with Master Tyndale."
</p>

<p>
Margaret went after Herman, who scarcely waited
for her, for he was on the move by the time her hand
touched his arm.
</p>

<p>
"What is in your mind, my dear?" she asked,
while they moved on into the forbidding blackness
beyond the room where they had been praying.
</p>

<p>
Herman put down his hand for hers, and clasped
it tightly to give her confidence.  Their eyes met,
and she saw how his sparkled with what seemed to
her to be hope.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to explore, little one.  It came to my
mind while we were on our knees that I had heard
my father say that once the city nearly fell into
the hands of an enemy because of a secret entrance
into it from the meadows.  May not this be it?"
</p>

<p>
Margaret's eyes grew round with astonishment,
and instantly she was alive to the possibilities.
If it were as Herman's father said, and this proved
to be the passage which was in reality the city's
vulnerable point, William Tyndale could get away
without having to run the gauntlet, as it were, in the
streets and on the quay.  He would escape
Cochlaeus, and possibly some of those black-robed
Familiars of the Inquisition who infested the
city.  What fear and grief and humiliation it
would save if such a way could be found!  No
danger would threaten her beloved.  There would
be a safe retreat for Tyndale, or at least the
opportunity for finding securer quarters elsewhere; and
Cochlaeus would waste some valuable time
prosecuting his search.
</p>

<p>
They came to a door which opened when Herman
pressed against it.  It moved silently and heavily,
and when they had passed through the opening,
and turned to look at it from the outer side, they
saw that it bore the same appearance as the rock in
which it was set.  When they closed it, it was
impossible, in the dim light of the lamp, to detect any
difference between it and the rock itself.
</p>

<p>
The two went on slowly, Margaret drawing close
to her lover's side, and, noticing this, he put his
arm about her waist to give her a sense of greater
security.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the path on which they found themselves
descended; but as they went, they saw that
it was leading on to some definite spot.  Surely it
could not be a <i>cul-de-sac</i>?  They could hardly fail
to find an outlet, but the question was, where?
Would it be as Herman's father had said&mdash;in the
meadows?  Or would it lead into some house, just
as it had begun in one?  In that latter case it
would mean the realisation of their worst fears,
and Tyndale would either be compelled to make
his venture through the streets, or if Herman should
be taken prisoner by the City Guard on some
suspicion, and Margaret as well, and Herman's
mother, he would lie in that hidden chamber, in
darkness and starvation, dying at last, rotting and
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Margaret shuddered at the thought.
</p>

<p>
"Art cold, little one?" Herman asked, feeling
the involuntary shiver of the girl at his side.
</p>

<p>
It was nothing to wonder at that she did so;
for here, where they were walking, their feet were
in the mire.  The dark walls were streaming with
water which spread out on the floor, forming pools
in places through which they splashed.
</p>

<p>
"I shivered at my thoughts," said Margaret
quietly, gazing into the darkness, wondering whether
she would see any sign of an ascending passage,
which might mean a rising to some house cellar
like Herman's.  She felt more hopeful when the floor
dipped again, and so suddenly that she slipped on
the slimy earth, and would have fallen but for
Herman's strong arm which kept her on her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Your thoughts?" exclaimed Herman questioningly.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking of what would happen if this
path ended at someone's house," she said, looking
carefully to her footing.
</p>

<p>
An exclamation escaped Herman's lips.  He had
hoped that a fear like that was only his, and not
hers, for the same idea had come to him.
</p>

<p>
"Who would have thought of such a thing as
that?" he said half laughingly, to hide his own
anxiety, but the girl at his side was not deceived.
</p>

<p>
"I thought so, Herman, and so did you," Margaret
said half reproachfully, clinging still more
tightly to her companion, for the way in front grew
blacker and more forbidding.  But on they went,
determined to know what the end of this
underground path would be.
</p>

<p>
"I believe we are in a great cavern, sweetheart,"
said Herman presently, when they halted involuntarily.
The floor on which they were treading was
no longer soft earth, but gravel and hard rock.
No walls were visible, nor could they see any roof.
</p>

<p>
Looking into denser blackness, they heard the
splash of water, and the lantern light showed a
gleaming drop falling.
</p>

<p>
Going forward, they came to a spot where the
dropping water had made for itself a hollow basin,
but, passing round it, they walked on.  Before they
had gone far they halted suddenly, and with an
exclamation of dismay; for, stretched full length
against the wall, down which some water trickled
freely, percolating through the rock overhead, lay
the body of a man whose flesh had gone, and time
had left nothing but the clothed skeleton&mdash;death
in its grimmest and most forbidding form.  By his
side, and clinging to him, lay a woman to whom
time had been just as unkind.  The man's hand
gripped a small book, and Herman, kneeling on the
floor to look, saw that it was opened at a page where
he read some words that were in startling contrast
with the end which had come to these who lay so
still.
</p>

<p>
"In my Father's house are many mansions."
</p>

<p>
It was easy to imagine the story of that tragedy.
Years before, the Inquisitors had hounded these
poor ones, and they had found a hiding-place which
became a death-chamber to them.  Not daring to
venture forth for food or liberty, they had died in
this cavern.
</p>

<p>
Margaret and Herman went on, the horror of this
discovery, and the pitifulness of it, thrilling them.
They had not gone far, tracing the cavern walls in
the hope of finding an exit, before they came to an
ascending passage, and they stood still again,
wondering to what it would lead.  Would it take
them to a house, and therefore to almost certain
danger?  Or would it lead them to the open country
outside the city?
</p>

<p>
The ground was damp and bare, and mildew was
on the walls; but as they went forward slowly and
cautiously, prepared to hurry back if danger
threatened, the lantern showed them moss in little
patches; then plants that were content with little
light so long as there was air to play about them.
</p>

<p>
Because of the cool air they felt that they were
coming near to some opening, and if they carried
a light it might betray them.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose we leave the lamp here, my dear,"
Margaret suggested.  "We can use it when we
return."
</p>

<p>
Herman nodded and set it down, and again they
moved on.  Now there were bushes, and presently
a sky was overhead, with scudding clouds, whose
jagged edges were fringed with silver whiteness by
the clear-shining moon.  The storm that had swept
the city had ended.
</p>

<p>
A few steps more, and they were confronted by
a bush, high, broad, and almost impenetrable, but,
finding a way through, they saw the meadow,
skirted by the river that rolled on in a stately flow.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
THE PRINTER'S WORKSHOP
</h3>

<p>
When they had gone back to the house,
and told of what they had seen, Herman
took Margaret home, and then the story
of the night's experiences was related to
Byrckmann, whose eyes brightened.
</p>

<p>
"God is in this.  Now I see daylight," he
exclaimed, turning to his daughter with a smile, the
first she had seen on his face, which was genuine,
since he had heard that Cochlaeus was in the city.
He had forced himself to look serene and unruffled
when his customers came to the shop, and had spoken
to the workmen as though care sat but lightly on
him; but whenever Margaret watched him while
he was alone she knew that he had covered his face
with a mask to hide his fear of approaching disaster.
</p>

<p>
But things had undergone a change, and Byrckmann
went to bed that night doing something that
was unwonted&mdash;humming to himself as though he
had no more dread.  Her father's cheerfulness and
obvious relief gave Margaret such a sense of safety
that she, too, slept soundly.
</p>

<p>
It was early morning when she got out of bed,
and, drawing back the curtain, she looked into the
street to see what sort of day was promising.  What
she saw surprised her, for John Gropper was crossing
the road to the shop.
</p>

<p>
"So early?" she muttered, for by the strokes
of the cathedral bell it wanted two hours before
the workmen would come for the day.  But she
asked no questions when it was her usual time for
going downstairs.
</p>

<p>
During the day the horses came to the door, and
the waggon was laden with bales; then moved
away in the direction of the quay.  She thought
nothing of it, because it was such a usual thing.
She saw at times how men came and went, talking
with her father at the counter, or going with him
into the workshop; but his care was so sensibly
diminished that she was able to move about
without that oppression at her heart.  She laughed
light-heartedly when Herman came, and told her
that he had spoken to her father, and that the
wedding could take place next week.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  You hold me lightly, as if I were goods
and chattels to be disposed of as two men might
arrange!" she cried, holding Herman off at arm's
length, her pretty face full of laughter, and her eyes
dancing.  "What if I decline?" she asked saucily.
</p>

<p>
"What if you decline, my pretty maid?" Herman
asked.  "When the morning comes I'll come,
and what would you do in my strong arms if I picked
you up, and carried you through the streets?"
</p>

<p>
"And expose me to the ridicule of every passer-by,"
she exclaimed archly.
</p>

<p>
"That way, whatever the passer-by may think,
my little maid, rather than not at all."
</p>

<p>
The day was ageing when a change came.  She
was telling her mother of things that had happened
downstairs; the queer requests of some of the
customers; the obstinacy of the new maid in the
kitchen; the gloom on the face of one of the
'prentices because he had mistaken the day when his
time expired, and he had two more weeks to serve;
of an unusually large order that had come in&mdash;a
dozen things like that; and the pale face of the
suffering woman grew rosier, and the lips parted in
smiles, and the mother chatted eagerly about her
daughter's wedding.
</p>

<p>
The joy passed suddenly, like a thunder-clap,
and the old care returned, and more fiercely because
she had thought it gone entirely.  The twilight was
coming as she sat at the window, telling her mother
what was going on in the street, the workmen
straggling off in ones and twos because the day's
work was ended.  It was not that which made the
rosy cheeks white, and drove the love-light from her
eyes, and made her heart beat with anxiety.  Not
that commonplace thing.
</p>

<p>
Some men were moving along the street, and the
sound came up to the open window, like the steady
tramp of soldiers.  Then she saw the City Guard.
</p>

<p>
She had already seen them go by twice that day,
but the conditions of the coming had changed.
Two men were walking with the Captain of the
Guard: one of them Cochlaeus; the other the
Dean of the Senate, who never accompanied the
Guard unless the business was of the most serious
import.
</p>

<p>
She hoped they would pass, but the soldiers
ranged up in a double line before the door of her
father's house, just as they had done in front of
Herman's home; and then the Captain and the
Dean followed Cochlaeus into the shop.
</p>

<p>
She was dismayed and confounded, for her
thoughts went to the cellar where the bundles were
hidden away.  These men had but to go there, and
the mere presence of the press would lend suspicion
as to its use in that unusual place.  They had but
to strip away one of the strong wrappers and they
would see those printed sheets!
</p>

<p>
"Mother, there is Mistress Amon passing!" she
exclaimed, making that her excuse for leaving the
room so abruptly.  She was going down to face the
trouble, for it must be that.
</p>

<p>
When she passed the doors on her way downstairs
the rooms seemed silent, tragic almost in
their suggestion of disaster.  A hush had come over
the place which boded ill, but there was the rush of
sound in her ears, and the beating of her heart.  A
mirror was at the bend of the stairs, and she was
startled to see her face; it looked so weary, and so
drawn with fear.
</p>

<p>
She went on, wanting to learn the worst.  It
meant so much for the home; for her father, of
whom she was so fond and proud; for her darling
mother, from whom they kept all the rough winds
of life because she had enough to bear in the way
of bodily pain.  Yes.  And it meant so much for
herself.  For how could she think of marriage
when she was known to the world as the daughter
of a man who was to die at the stake, or, as an
act of uncommon mercy, to end his days at the
galleys?
</p>

<p>
At the foot of the dark stairs she stood unseen,
either by her father, or the Dean, or Cochlaeus.
The Dean was unusually serious, and it was easy to
see that his errand was an unwelcome one; solely
one of duty; whereas Cochlaeus betrayed his
satisfaction at the prospect of seeing Byrckmann
undone, and Tyndale's hope of getting his Bible
printed vanish.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
COCHLAEUS AND THE SOLDIERS SEARCHING THE PRINTER'S WORKSHOP.
</p>

<p>
What struck her most was her father's bearing.
He was faced, she knew, with ruin, and she did not
see how he could escape discovery.  Cochlaeus was
reputed to be well versed in all the tricks of heretics
to hide their guilt, and he was not easily baffled.
Yet her father was quite at ease.  He was grave
enough, but he had not the bearing of a man who
feared the outcome of this search.  Margaret saw
the Dean look at him askance.
</p>

<p>
They went to the workshop, followed by a couple
of soldiers, who left their halberds in the shop as
being too cumbersome to carry in the winding
passages.
</p>

<p>
Margaret stole after them, but was careful to
keep out of sight.  The workmen were all gone
home, and through the glass door she saw that the
workshop was left as usual.  Printed sheets lay
about.  The presses were there, empty, waiting for
the morning.  The written papers which were copy
for the printing were in the usual places, and tools,
and ink, and other things.
</p>

<p>
Her father contented himself with waving his
hand, but she heard him say:
</p>

<p>
"This is my workshop.  Search as you will."
</p>

<p>
The searchers moved in all directions, and
Cochlaeus, more active than any, looked around for
hidden places, and seemed to be calculating the
thickness of the walls, suggestive of room for hiding;
but there was nothing to bear out his suspicions in
that matter.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was discovered in the workshop, although
with his strong hand Cochlaeus tore open every
package to see that nothing in them was likely
to belong to Tyndale.  Even the paper wanted
for printing was dealt with in the same ruthless way,
until Byrckmann's patience reached its limit, and
he made a protest to the Dean.
</p>

<p>
"This priest, who has no official standing in the
city, has chosen to suspect me, yet he is welcome
to make his search.  But prevent him from doing
such wanton damage to my goods, or I will sue the
Senate for the charges."
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus swung round and stared in amazement
at the printer, but he caught the glint in his
eyes, and saw that Byrckmann, far from being afraid,
was almost defiant.  He went about his work more
carefully, and did no more preventible damage.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was found; nor in the inner shop, where
special work was done.  But what of that?  Margaret's
mind was on the cellar, where the real danger
lay.  She watched anxiously, lest any stray piece
of paper might betray her father, but she wondered
whether, with all his sharpness, Cochlaeus would
think of the cellar.
</p>

<p>
"Master Byrckmann," cried Cochlaeus peremptorily,
"remove the bundles from this side of the
room, so that we may see the floor beneath."
</p>

<p>
"Nay; I do not make the search," came the
sturdy answer.  "'Tis not for me to give a hand in
what you think will be my undoing."
</p>

<p>
The tone was decisive.  The Dean looked askance
at the printer, and muttered to himself that
Byrckmann did not bear himself like a man who had
anything to fear.  He turned to the soldiers, and bade
them remove the bales to the other side of the
room.  They responded sulkily, for this was not
their work.  As the last bale was dropped on top of
the others, Cochlaeus stamped over the cleared
space.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  This is hollow!"
</p>

<p>
Bending low, he scanned every part of the floor,
and at last he went on his knees to feel about for any
sign of an opening.
</p>

<p>
"Byrckmann, come and raise the floor!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, 'tis your business, not mine," was the quiet
retort.  "'Tis your search, as I told you just now;
not mine.  You can lift it as readily as I."
</p>

<p>
The Dean looked round again and, ignoring the
Captain of the Guard, who yielded to his superior,
he nodded to a soldier.  The man came forward
and, looking carefully, thrust in the point of his sword
at the spot where the floor seemed to be moveable,
and, lifting it, threw it back with a noisy clatter
and a prodigious dust.
</p>

<p>
"Now we shall see!" cried Cochlaeus triumphantly,
and he hurried down the steps.  The
Deacon of the Church of the Blessed Virgin had
discarded his dignity in his eagerness.
</p>

<p>
Every pulse in Margaret throbbed wildly.  She
felt like falling in a fainting heap, but she controlled
herself, and watched, to mark the fatal ending of
this quest.  Yet she marvelled to mark her
father's ease.
</p>

<p>
As the last soldier moved down, and his head
went out of sight, she was more amazed than ever
to see him rub his hands, and his face broaden into
a smile.  She wondered whether he had suddenly
gone mad with the strain of the last few days, and
therefore he did not realise his danger.
</p>

<p>
Presently a soldier's head appeared, and his face,
when it came in sight, had a whimsical look on it.
So it was with the next, and he stamped his foot as
his heavy boot touched the floor.  He dropped his
sword noisily into its scabbard, as if there would be
no use for it.
</p>

<p>
The Dean came into view, impassive as before,
unless one could interpret that peculiar look on his
lean face as one of satisfaction because the quest
had ended so.  There was bewilderment in the
Captain's face when he also emerged from the
cellar.
</p>

<p>
Last of all came Cochlaeus, and his sinister face
was red with wrath.  As he stepped away from the
ladder he swung round on Byrckmann, and spoke
in a passionate tone.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you not say there was nothing here to
connect you with that fellow Tyndale?"
</p>

<p>
"You put no question that I could so answer,"
was the quiet, but exasperating response.  "You
came to my shop, and without asking me anything,
you said, 'We have come to search your premises.'  You
did not say for what, and since the Dean was
here, a man whom I esteem, I offered no protest,
although you have no authority in this city, and
suffered you to have your way.  You have had it."
</p>

<p>
While the soldiers left the house, Cochlaeus
stamped to and fro, protesting against being made
a laughing-stock.
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said the Dean quietly.  "You came to
the Senate House and lodged your information in
such confident terms that Master Byrckmann was
printing off this Bible for Tyndale, that we granted
you the opportunity for the search.  You cannot
blame the printer because his hands are clean in
this matter."
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus scowled and walked away, while
Margaret, still wondering how it came about that
the cellar was clear, followed him through the shop,
and gazed after him through the window when he
stalked along in anger down the silent street.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE MAN BY THE RIVER
</h3>

<p>
There was the sound of footsteps behind her,
and, turning quickly, Margaret saw her
father walking to the door, where he drove
the bolt into the socket.
</p>

<p>
"What does it all mean?" she asked eagerly,
looking at him across the counter.  "Father, my
heart was almost bursting with anxiety; for when
I saw those men searching the workshop, and
Cochlaeus asked for the floor to be raised, there was
no way out of the dreadful pass that I could see.
I thought to see them go into the cellar and find the
printing-press and those printed sheets.  It was
almost more than I could bear!"
</p>

<p>
She sank on the stool and buried her face in her
hands, shuddering, and thus she stayed until her
father bent over the counter to her, and gently
stroked her hair.
</p>

<p>
"It was thoughtless of me, my dear," he said
soothingly; "and I ought to have told you what
I did.  Gropper and I pulled the press to pieces and
placed it in the storeroom.  Then we spent another
long night in covering William Tyndale's sheets
with strong wrappers for a long journey, and they
were taken in a waggon to a ship which is lying at
the quay.  There they are, stowed away in safety,
where even Cochlaeus would scarcely find them."
</p>

<p>
"Then I saw them," she cried.
</p>

<p>
"They went this morning," the printer said
light-heartedly; and for awhile, as the shadows
fell and twilight gave place to darkness, save for
the light which came in through the window from
the lantern in the street, they talked of this danger
which had threatened them.
</p>

<p>
"If only Master Tyndale were well out of the
city," Byrckmann muttered.  "I would go to him,
but it would be unwise.  Someone would see me,
perhaps, and Gropper must not."
</p>

<p>
"Let me go," said Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis dark."
</p>

<p>
"I have been in the streets far later than this,
father.  Don't you remember?"
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for more, Margaret went to her
room for her cloak and hood.
</p>

<p>
"What is the message?" she asked, coming into
the shop again, fastening a dainty bow under her
chin.  She pulled the bow into shape and buttoned
her cloak.  "Give me the message and a kiss, and
let me start."
</p>

<p>
"I will come part way with you, my dear," her
father said; "but I will tell you before we leave
the shop.  The walls of the city seem to be all ears
of late."
</p>

<p>
He took down his cap and buckled a sword on his
thigh; then, having whispered the message, which
he made her repeat, to know that it was thoroughly
understood, he led the way into the street.
</p>

<p>
They parted at the archway where Margaret
had sheltered from the storm, and she thought for
a moment of the man who had been standing there.
Byrckmann stood well in the shadow and watched
his daughter, but when she came to the bend in the
long street he hurried after her, to make sure that
no harm came to her.  From a dark doorway he
watched, and saw her stop at Herman's door, and
presently she passed into the house.  After that
he went to Gropper, but returned home, as he put
it to himself, like a thief in the night, alert for every
sound, and fearful lest he should meet the City
Guard.  The experiences of the day had shaken his
nerve, and the very air seemed full of danger.
</p>

<p>
Herman's mother answered Margaret's knock on
the door, and when she saw the girl she drew her
into the dark passage, and thrust in the bolt.
</p>

<p>
"Herman," she called.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mother," was the answer from the top of
the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"A young lady to see you, my son," was the
laughing call.
</p>

<p>
"Give her a kiss, mother&mdash;a nice one; and tell
her I'll be down in two minutes!" the young
man cried, his strong, clear voice vibrating with
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"I was dressing to come round to see your father,"
he said, before long, gazing at her as she stood in
the lantern's light, looking radiant in her young
beauty, her laughing face betraying the fact that
in her love for Herman she had banished all her
care.
</p>

<p>
"My father!" she exclaimed archly.  "Would
you dress like that to see him?"  But he smothered
her with kisses as soon as he had set down the lamp,
and his hands were free.
</p>

<p>
"I am come on business, Herman," she said
presently.  "Father sent me with a message for
Master Tyndale."
</p>

<p>
"He is in the cavern," said Herman doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go to him at once," Margaret exclaimed,
leading the way to the front room, and going into
the darkness before Herman had brought the
light; but ere long she was face to face with
Tyndale.
</p>

<p>
"My father told me to say to you, 'Get you
gone out of the city, for Cochlaeus is on your track.'  He
has been to our home to search for your printed
sheets."
</p>

<p>
"And did he find them?" Tyndale asked
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"No.  My father anticipated his coming, and the
bundles are all on board a ship called the <i>Marburg</i>,
now lying at the quay.  She leaves to-night.  He
suggests that you should go through the cavern,
of which I told him, and wait at the riverside, where
you or Herman will send an owl's cry over the water
as the vessel passes.  He is gone to Gropper's house
to bid him see the skipper, and ask him to leave at
ten o'clock to-night.  He is to listen for the owl's
call, and take you on board."
</p>

<p>
There was no need for haste.  Quietly and
persistently Tyndale gathered up his few belongings.
Some were most precious, but woe for him if
Cochlaeus laid hands on them.  He set them on the
table at which he had been working when Margaret
entered the lonely underground room, and he suffered
her to look at them.  One was a New Testament,
the Latin version by Erasmus.  The other was
the Vulgate, and from these two books he was
basing his translation into English for the people
at home to read.
</p>

<p>
There was so much more than when he entered
the city, a worn-out traveller, borne in Herman's
arms.  Then it was the heavy wallet, swung pilgrim-like
on his shoulder, holding these precious volumes,
and two or three necessaries, but no more.  Now
there were sheets on which he had laboured
incessantly, almost feverishly, page after page, making
a heap of papers, each scored over and corrected
before he placed it on the pile with the others.
These had to go with a few proofs which had
come from Byrckmann's shop, smudged and rough
from the printing-press.  They had to be wrapped
about with something, and presently they were
ready to be borne in the wallet like a soldier's
knapsack.
</p>

<p>
"A dangerous burden," said Tyndale quietly,
when it lay on the table, "but a precious one;
and in God's mercy it may more than balance much
of the wickedness and sorrow in the world," he
added, with kindling enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
It wanted nearly an hour to the time when the
<i>Marburg</i> would leave her moorings and move up
the river.  They divided the burdens among them,
Margaret's share being the lantern, and with this
she led the way.  She shuddered when she passed
the spot where those dead ones were lying, but
she did not tarry, and she only spoke when she
whispered back a warning where to stoop, and where
the footing was treacherous.
</p>

<p>
When they came into the open the moon was low
down on the horizon, peeping between the heavy
foliage of some trees, but making the shadow dense
in which they sheltered themselves.  Overhead
were the glinting stars, Venus riding a few inches
higher in the heavens than Jupiter, and close at
hand was the dark and slowly moving river which
reflected the sparkling sky dots and the dense
bushes on the opposite bank.  The waters were
almost soundless but for the gurgle as they played
with the plants and flowers which bent and nodded
as the current moved.
</p>

<p>
Waiting but alert, they saw a great mass moving
in the middle of the stream.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a raft," said Herman, when he had peered
beneath his hand.  There were lights on it, and, as
they flared, the watchers saw people moving to and
fro, and when the moon uncovered her face there
were ragged tents, and women sitting near them
with their little ones about them.
</p>

<p>
"So much the better for your journey, Master
Tyndale," said Herman, as the moving mass went
by.  "The river will be clear for the next few days."
</p>

<p>
The huge floating mass disappeared at a bend
in the stream, and again the eyes of the watchers
scanned the waters for some sign of the <i>Marburg</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I would that William Roye had been less
dilatory," Tyndale said presently.  "He promised
to meet me weeks ago, and said he would send word
as to his coming."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he heard that there was danger and
dared not come," Herman suggested, without
taking his eyes away from the river.
</p>

<p>
"William Roye was ever afraid of his skin," said
Tyndale half bitterly.  "But he would have been
useful to me as my amanuensis."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" exclaimed Herman, starting.  "What
was that?"
</p>

<p>
A few yards away he saw a man crawl into view
from the bank, and stand up at his full height.
From the same spot a boat was pulling into the
centre of the stream as if to overtake the raft, which
was no more in sight.
</p>

<p>
It might mean much.  It might mean nothing.
But whether friend or foe it was not desirable to
have anyone so near when the ship they were awaiting
might soon come into view.  Yet nothing could
be done.
</p>

<p>
"Stand well back in the shadows," Herman
whispered.  "The man may move away."
</p>

<p>
It was a difficulty for which they were not
prepared.  The bare idea of a little company, bent on
furthering God's work in the world, resorting to
violence was unthinkable; yet, to be cooped up like
this, and suffer the ship to go by without her
passenger, spelt disaster, for Cochlaeus was a veritable
sleuth-hound, and might run Tyndale to earth.
</p>

<p>
The stranger appeared indifferent whether he
was seen or heard, and time seemed to him of no
importance, since he looked about him idly.  The
moon began to flood the meadows more freely,
so that the fields and the dells, the woods and
cornfields, the distant mountain slopes and their torrents
became visible, but the man was the object from
which those in hiding could not take their eyes.
</p>

<p>
The puzzle was to know what to do.  The impulse
came to Herman to walk along the bank as a
casual wayfarer, and he would accost the man and
lure him away, so that he would not see Tyndale
join the ship.  So much hung on the secret movements
of him in whose wallet such precious things
were hidden.
</p>

<p>
Before he had time to decide, the man was on
the move.  He walked at first apparently without
an aim, but he swung round and approached the
bushes where the others were hiding.  As he drew
nearer, the moonlight showed him plainly, a man of
fine physique; and he, too, had a pilgrim's wallet
on his back.
</p>

<p>
He paused to scan the stream again, attracted
by the silver glint on the waters.  The man coughed,
and Margaret started.  She had heard a sound like
it somewhere, but where and when she could not
tell.  The man, drawing nearer to the bush, halted
again, and spoke to himself in a grumbling tone.
</p>

<p>
"To think of missing my entrance into the city
like this!  Now I have to stay here the whole night
through, and go in in the broad light of day, when
God knows who may spot me, and what may chance."
</p>

<p>
Margaret remembered the voice.  It was the
form of the man to whom she had spoken when she
sheltered in the archway from the pelting rain.  It
was certainly his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Herman," she whispered, "do you remember
what I told you of the man in the archway the
other night&mdash;the man who cursed the Inquisitors
for what they had done for his daughter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, what of it?" asked Herman, keeping a
watchful eye on the intruder.
</p>

<p>
"That is the man."
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Certain."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder whether I dare go to him and speak,"
said Herman, half to himself; but Tyndale
suddenly sprang to his feet, and tramped past him,
muttering as he went.  Herman threw out his hand
to catch at him, but was too late.  Tyndale was
stalking on towards the man, who heard him
coming, and, alarmed, had put his hand to the
dagger in his belt.
</p>

<p>
"William Roye," exclaimed Tyndale.
</p>

<p>
The two men met, and clasped hands while they
stood face to face.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
ROYE AND THE INQUISITORS
</h3>

<p>
After that hearty greeting, Tyndale and
Roye walked to and fro on the river-bank,
so absorbed in the pleasure of their meeting
that they forgot the danger of moving
about in the clear moonlight.  Herman, growing
anxious, called to them that they were running
needless risks.
</p>

<p>
"I forgot!" exclaimed Tyndale.  "It was such a
joy to see William Roye that everything went."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas a dangerous absent-mindedness," said
Herman, almost sharply, looking round while he
spoke, to make sure that none were near enough
to observe them.  While he did so, Tyndale hurried
to the bush, followed by his companion, and they
hid themselves in the shadows, with the others.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear Roye, explain yourself," said
Tyndale, almost peremptorily, sitting on the grass
in a place so dark that one could scarcely see the
other.  "Why did you stay away so long?  I have
been working feverishly and unceasingly all these
weeks, and the Lord's work has tarried because I
have but this one poor pair of hands to do the work
of two."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, master," the response came quietly.
"In some degree I am to blame, but not so much
as it would appear."
</p>

<p>
Tyndale answered half reproachfully, for now
that the pleasure of meeting had given place to
reflection, he felt that the man for whom he had
sent so urgently had failed him, and hindered his
task.  So many weeks had gone.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot but blame you, whatever your excuse!"
he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, master, do not say that.  Let me explain.
Your letter found me, and I read it by the light
of a street lamp.  Perhaps it was the act of a
madman, but a lad gave it to me by night when I
was out walking.  He dogged my steps until we were
in a quiet street, and he caught up to me and
whispered:
</p>

<p>
"'Are you William Roye?'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, but why?' I asked, rather startled, for I
thought I was an unknown man among strangers.
</p>

<p>
"'Then I have to give you this,' and he thrust your
letter into my hand, and seemed to vanish in the
darkness.  I knew at once that it came from you,
for I know your handwriting so well.  I broke the
seal and began to read, but by the time I got to the
end and saw your name I was startled.  I chanced
to look up, and saw two black-robed figures coming
towards me."
</p>

<p>
Roye stopped, and clasped his hands convulsively,
as if the memory of it, even, was overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
"Were they Familiars?" asked Tyndale eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, master.  Hear you me, Master Tyndale?"
he exclaimed hoarsely, his voice little more than a
whisper.  "They were Familiars.  You know what
need I have to dread them, yes, and to curse them,"
he went on, wringing his hands, his breath catching
with a sob.  "Did they not, or the City Guard for
them, which was all the same&mdash;did they not come
to my home and take my darling Gertrude from me
to that dark dungeon of theirs?
</p>

<p>
"But these men came on me unexpectedly in the
street; and they came with that horrible, weird
tread, almost soundless, and so the more fearful.
I stood where I was, beneath the street lamp,
transfixed, holding the letter in my hand, and staring at
them, open-mouthed.
</p>

<p>
"They must have seen that I was desperately
frightened.  Oh, fool that I was!  I was betraying
myself to those black-souled, black-robed night-hawks,
and there was the letter trembling in my
hand!
</p>

<p>
"They drew level with me, and I watched,
praying that they might pass on; but they did not.
One spoke to the other, though I do not know what
he said, and in a moment he thrust out his hand
to clutch at the letter.
</p>

<p>
"In an instant I was alert.  Had he got hold of
it the consequences would have been terrible.  They
would have known where you were hiding.  The
address was on the letter, and that black-hearted
villain, Cochlaeus, would have been on your track."
</p>

<p>
Roye stopped, and there was silence, Those who
listened were spellbound, for they realised the
possibilities.  Those Familiars would have come
straight to the door of Herman's house!
</p>

<p>
Margaret's brain reeled at the thought of what
might have come to her lover and his mother.  She
caught at Herman's great hand convulsively, and
he, travelling on the same road of thought, bent
down and kissed her fingers softly.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," cried Tyndale, almost querulously, for
the suspense was hard to bear.  "Go on, Roye!
Why do you pause and tantalise us?  Who knows
but that the man, Cochlaeus, may even now be at
Herman Bengel's door!"
</p>

<p>
While he spoke, Tyndale drew off his cap, and
wiped his face, which had gone damp with fear.
</p>

<p>
"I crave your pardon, Master Tyndale," Roye
answered quickly.  "I was somewhat overcome
with the thoughts that are rushing through my
soul.  But I will tell you all.
</p>

<p>
"I stepped back when I saw the Familiar's hand
come out, and I held the letter behind me.  But the
man followed me, saying sternly, 'Give me that
paper.'
</p>

<p>
"'Tis mine!' I cried, and now I remember how
my voice rang out on the night.
</p>

<p>
"I marvel at my boldness, but in those moments
I thought, not of my own peril, but of the
consequences to my master if I gave up the letter.  I
thought how your safety would be imperilled, your
life, indeed, and God's work brought to a standstill."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, dear Roye," came Tyndale's urgent
words, and the others seemed in their imagination
almost to hear the footfall of the City Guard, and
the loud knock on Herman's door, and then his
mother answering it to find herself faced by
Cochlaeus and the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"'Give me that paper!' the man reiterated,
and suddenly, when he came forward with a swift
step, he snatched at it.  But, thank God!  I
hindered him.  The consequences, if he got it into
his possession, awoke in me a boldness at which
I have trembled a score of times since then.  Had
there been time for cold thought I might have given
it to him meekly, obsessed with that unconquerable
force that is behind the minions of the Inquisition.
But the impulse came, and I acted on it.  The
menacing hand&mdash;thin and claw-like&mdash;went very
near the letter.  It had almost clutched it; but I
lifted my own.  See, Master Tyndale!  Mark what
my fist is like."
</p>

<p>
Roye held it out for the others to see, and as it
was so stretched forth the moonlight fell on it.  It
was tightly clenched, and Margaret gazed at it,
wondering who could stand up against a blow
from it.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-090.jpg" alt="&quot;THE FAMILIAR FELL LIKE A LOG ON THE STONES AT MY FEET&quot;">
<br>
&quot;THE FAMILIAR FELL LIKE A LOG ON THE STONES AT MY FEET&quot;
</p>

<p>
"I lifted my fist, Master Tyndale, and brought
it down on that black mask.  My whole strength
went into the blow, and I heard the man gasp.  His
hands went up in self-protection, for I struck him
again.  The first blow awoke me.  The second came
because I thought of my darling Gertrude.  I
struck a third time, and he fell like a log on the
stones at my feet, and lay still&mdash;dead, perhaps.  I
do not know.
</p>

<p>
"The second Familiar came forward with a cry
of rage.  He shouted to me that by daring to strike
his companion I had outraged the Church, and,
screaming out his words, he flung himself upon me.
I still had my child in my mind, and as I stepped
aside I struck at him.  He staggered sideways, but
recovered himself, but when he came at me again, he
fell back with my blow, and lay across his fellow."
</p>

<p>
Margaret and her companions breathed more
freely, for it seemed to them that the Familiars had
failed to get possession of the letter; but she longed
to know what happened.
</p>

<p>
"What followed then?" she asked, laying her
hand on Roye's arm.
</p>

<p>
"What followed!  I hurried away lest I might
be seen; but as I went down the street with the
letter in my hand, two other Familiars met me.
The light of a street lantern fell on the white paper,
and I realised that the same thing might happen
here as with those other two.  What should I do?
If I tore it up those men might gather up the pieces,
and with patience they could put them together
again, and read it all.  Then they would see Master
Tyndale's name, and the place where he lodged.
</p>

<p>
"The Familiars were some distance away,
standing beneath a swinging lamp to read the names,
perhaps, on the sheet they held&mdash;the names of some
poor creatures doomed to the torture chamber.  I
tore off my master's name, and, thrusting the piece
of paper in my mouth, I ground it between my
teeth and swallowed it.  Then I tore out the
address, and swallowed that as well.  Even then I
was afraid of the consequences.  God alone could
tell what they might have got from what was left
who found it, so I turned down an alley, and in the
darkness swallowed it all."
</p>

<p>
Roye stopped.  Margaret laughed low in sheer
relief, for now no Familiars could be at Herman's
street door.  Herman chuckled, while Tyndale
rubbed his hands with satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Still I do not understand your long absence,
William," he said presently.  "How does it
account for the weeks that have gone by without
your coming to my lodgings?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, master, of course," said Roye, who seemed
to have forgotten the purpose for which he was telling
the story of his adventures.  "I ate the letter,
but in my haste I had taken no note of the address.
I wanted to know what you were writing to me.  I
only knew the name of the city, not the name of
the street."
</p>

<p>
He heard the subdued laughter of the girl at his
side, but was not much disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
"A natural thing, William," said Tyndale.
</p>

<p>
"It was, master.  The great thing, first of all,
was to prevent discovery.  Then I was confronted
with a real difficulty&mdash;the task of finding you.  I
came at once to the city, and all through the weary
days since then I have gone through and through
the streets, not daring to ask for you, but hoping as
well as praying that I might find you."
</p>

<p>
"I saw you!" exclaimed Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"You saw me?" the man retorted incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Do you remember the night when the
rain poured down, and you sheltered in an
archway?  I came while you were standing there.
Had I but known!" Margaret added earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Was it you?" asked Roye, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and I was even then going to the house
where Master Tyndale lodged."
</p>

<p>
"If I had but known!" the man exclaimed,
repeating Margaret's words.  "Then, master, I had
proved my loyalty to you and your great work, and
my honest wish to serve you."
</p>

<p>
Tyndale did not answer, for something came
looming out of the darkness, when a heavy cloud
had cast dark shadows on the river&mdash;the form of a
slowly moving ship.  She slid out into the
moonlight, and as she took clear shape, Herman knew
her by the peculiar figurehead at her bows.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the <i>Marburg</i>!" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Hurrying to the bank, and taking great risk while
doing so, he sent a plaintive and monotonous owl
note travelling through the air.  He did it again
and again until a man in the ship's bows held up his
hand by way of answer to the call, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Before long a boat came noiselessly, the oars
being muffled, and presently she struck her nose
against the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Is Master Tyndale ready?"
</p>

<p>
The question came cautiously from a man in the
boat's stern.  Happily the clouds had again
gathered, and none, had any been watching, could
have seen Tyndale step from among the bushes
and make his way to the bank.
</p>

<p>
"I am here.  Are you not very late?"
</p>

<p>
"A bit," was the sturdy, but whispered answer.
"It couldn't be helped.  That fellow, Cochlaeus,
has been prowling about the harbour for the last
three hours, and, not content with asking who was
on board any of the ships that meant to leave
to-night, he went aboard every one of them, and
rummaged about in the cabins and down the holds,
tapping everywhere where there was a possible
place for a man to hide in.  The <i>Marburg</i> came in
for special attention."
</p>

<p>
Tyndale stood on the bank and listened, and the
moonlight, playing on his face, revealed the
intensity of his anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Did he find anything?  Was he suspicious
about those precious bundles?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, master; his whole aim was to lay those
long lean fingers of his on flesh and blood.  And
something laughable happened, although some
of us sweated with anxiety at first.  Cochlaeus got
down into the hold, where there were some casks,
and these he tapped with his staff, as he tapped
every mortal thing there was.  Some of them
sounded hollow, and he turned them over, but when
he came to one and turned that on its side, a man
sprawled out."
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus caught at him.
</p>

<p>
"'Ha!  Master Tyndale, I have you at last!'
he cried jubilantly, but a moment later he screamed
aloud.  It was Heinrich, the simple lad in the
city, who, for some freak, had stolen on board to
have a free ride up the river, and hid himself thus,
that none should know.
</p>

<p>
"He was frightened when he saw that it was
Cochlaeus who had gripped him, and in his frenzy
of fear he snapped at the hand of the heretic hunter,
closing his teeth upon the long bony fingers, making
him scream with pain.  But Heinrich would not
let go.  Not he!  He seemed to take a delight in
making the Deacon of the Church of the Blessed
Virgin dance about, and he bit the harder.  Ah! how
he bit! and some of the sailors laughed till the
tears came, hoping that the simple lad would bite
the harder, to part repay the brute for the sorrow
and pain he had caused to so many who had come
into his power.
</p>

<p>
"When the Captain came, wondering what the
laughter and the screams meant, he persuaded the
boy to loosen his teeth; but not until he had
clenched his teeth for a final bite.
</p>

<p>
"'I'll bite harder if ever he lays hands on me
again!' Heinrich cried, looking at the Churchman,
and there was a mad light in his eyes."
</p>

<p>
The sailor dropped his laughter, and became
serious.
</p>

<p>
"Poor lad," he muttered.  "And yet I am glad
he showed his teeth to that fierce tormentor, and
made him think, perhaps, of the poor girls, and the
mothers, and the men he has tormented in those
ghastly cellars of the Holy Houses.  But come,
Master Tyndale.  The ship is moving down the
stream, and will not wait for us."
</p>

<p>
Tyndale stepped into the boat, dropping his
wallet at his feet before he sank on the seat.
</p>

<p>
"Come, William," he said to Roye, whose foot
was on the gunwale.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, William, if that is what they call you,"
said the sailor, holding up a refusing hand.  "I only
take Master Tyndale."
</p>

<p>
"But you must take him, friend!" exclaimed
Tyndale, bending forward eagerly.  "'Tis William
Roye, my amanuensis, and if he does not come with
me my work will be greatly hindered."
</p>

<p>
"Then in Christ's name, good man, come and be
welcome.  All who have a hand in spreading God's
truth may have a place on board the <i>Marburg</i>, and
I know the Captain will approve."
</p>

<p>
A few moments more and the boat shot away
from the bank into the stream, and was lost in the
darkness, which was providential when so many
eyes might be prying into the doings of the night.
For the clear shining moon had gone behind some
dense clouds and shrouded the river and the meadows
and the city near by in blackness.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
ALONE IN THE CAVERN
</h3>

<p>
Only once did the moon peep through a rift
in the cloud to light up the waters and show
the <i>Marburg</i> making her slow way against
the stream.  It was a fleeting glimpse
which the watchers had as they stood on the bank
before they turned to find their way back to the
house by the cavern way.  The shaft of silver, as it
fell, revealed the dim form of the vessel which carried
such a precious burden with it, and a life which
meant so much for the world's weal.
</p>

<p>
Then darkness fell again.
</p>

<p>
Herman and Margaret stood hand in hand, gazing
into the blackness, hoping that the clouds would
drift by, and the sky be cleared to show them the
empty river, with the ship gone out of sight, and
safely away from the jurisdiction of the authorities
of the city.  Instead, they came more and more
heavily, and the darkness grew denser.
</p>

<p>
After a while they sat down and began to talk of
their own concerns, and the married life they were
going to lead within the week.  Margaret, with her
lover's arm about her, told him what her hopes
were; but she spoke as well of her diffidence, lest he
might be disappointed in his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, little sweetheart," whispered Herman,
drawing her closer, so that their lips met.  "'Twill
be the finest bargain any man ever made; the best
gift God ever gave to anyone.  And when I think
of it, 'tis hard to contain myself, that this day week
you will be mine."
</p>

<p>
Margaret was going to answer, but a sound came,
and she bent forward to gaze into the darkness
towards the harbour from whence the <i>Marburg</i> had
come.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" Herman asked.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear the sound of a man's feet?  Can
you not hear some voices?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
The stillness of the night, while they listened, was
broken by the sound of voices and the tread of feet.
It was no thing of the imagination.  At first there
was but a distant murmuring, but now it was undeniable
that men were coming, swiftly, persistently,
and, judging from the tone of their voices, they were
greatly incensed.
</p>

<p>
Before long, while Margaret and her companion
sat shadowed from observation by the bush, they
began to distinguish the words.
</p>

<p>
"To think that I should have been duped like
that," cried one.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Cochlaeus," Margaret whispered, but
Herman made no answer.  The man was saying more,
and he would not miss a word.
</p>

<p>
"I went through the ship, and through it again,
but found no trace of that accursed Englishman;
not a sound nor a sign of his presence.  Nothing
came of my search but the discovery of that mad
stowaway, who has left marks on my fingers that
will stay for many a day."
</p>

<p>
The company halted close by, and Herman and
Margaret, holding themselves in silence, neither
moving hand nor foot, scarcely breathing lest they
should betray their presence, peered into the
darkness.  Accustomed to it by this long night vigil,
they saw the indistinct forms of six men, but who
they were, or whether armed, it was impossible to
tell.  What they heard set their hearts palpitating
with fear.
</p>

<p>
"What can you do?" one asked, who had gone
closer to the bank, as if to gaze up the broad stream.
</p>

<p>
"I mean to overtake the <i>Marburg</i>, go on board,
and search afresh for Tyndale," said Cochlaeus,
almost viciously.
</p>

<p>
"And if you find him?" asked the other, speaking
back over his shoulder, but not moving from the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Make an end both of him and his accursed
practices," came the hot answer.  "Canst see the
ship?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
Margaret thought she knew the voice of the man
on the look out, and presently her suspicion became
a certainty.  The man who spoke to Cochlaeus on
equal terms was the Dean, who had accompanied
the search-party in her father's shop.
</p>

<p>
"Let us start, and we may overtake her!" cried
the Deacon.  "None will see us walking on the
bank, so that for once the darkness is a blessing in
disguise."
</p>

<p>
"And what then?" the Dean asked impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
The response betrayed astonishment at such
simplicity.
</p>

<p>
"What then?  I will board her, of course, and
search again.  What else should I do?  What less
could I?  That fellow on the wharf said that he
saw one go on board who answered to Tyndale in
every point, and I would give half of all I have to
lay hands on him."
</p>

<p>
The Dean spoke curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go if we must, since you seem so set on
it.  But I warn you that it will be a fool's errand."
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus was on the move at once, and it seemed
to those who were hiding in the bush that the company
went forward in a straggling line, not one among
them willingly, save the man who led.
</p>

<p>
It was alarming to Margaret and Herman to find
that after all that had been done, when things
appeared to be going so well, and when in fancy they
saw Tyndale sitting in a quiet room somewhere in
the city where Martin Luther lived, absorbed in his
holy task, this persistent sleuth-hound was on
his track, and shortly, whereas he was imagining
himself safe, he might be in the hands of his
tormentors, and his dream of a great task completed
broken in upon.
</p>

<p>
"Herman," Margaret whispered, afraid to move
lest she might betray her presence, although the
sound of the men's footsteps had grown indistinct
as they fell on the meadow grass.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, little one?"
</p>

<p>
"They will find him, and they will kill him!"
she exclaimed, her voice breaking.
</p>

<p>
Herman was holding her hand, and it felt damp
with her sudden fear.
</p>

<p>
"I will take you home, my dear, and then go
after them.  I shall do my best to pass them, for I
shall go fleetly, and give warning to those on board
the <i>Marburg</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You will be too late!" Margaret protested.
"It will take you an hour or more to go back with
me, and then those men will have gone so far that
you will not overtake them, much less pass them."
</p>

<p>
She buried her face in her hands, for the vision
had come to her in those moments of dread, of a
godly man in the hands of the tormentors, tortured,
and then for a certainty bound to the stake for
death.  It was a terrible thought that this saintly
man should be cut off in the midst of his splendid
work, and be counted among the martyrs.
</p>

<p>
She lifted her face, and because at the moment
the clouds drifted by, Herman saw that it was wet
with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Go now, Herman," she cried, springing to her
feet, and holding up her lips for him to kiss.  "Go
now!"
</p>

<p>
"And leave you to go through the cavern and
home alone?  I cannot.  I will not!"
</p>

<p>
"You must, Herman.  I can go alone.  What is
my loneliness compared with that good man's life?
Would you have the world irremediably impoverished
because a girl like me must needs have an
escort?  Go, Herman," she ended imploringly,
with a hand on either shoulder, as she looked up
into her lover's face.
</p>

<p>
He sought to persuade her, but she was resolute.
</p>

<p>
"My beloved, go, and God go with you.  Save
the good man, for he will certainly die if Cochlaeus
lays hands on him.  And in that case I shall never
again know any happiness."
</p>

<p>
She wound her arms about his neck, and
kissed him.  But then she waited no more.  When
she disengaged herself from Herman's arms she
turned away and hurried to the cavern's entrance.
Before he quite knew what she meant to do she was
on her way, and all that he could hear was the sound
of light but hurried footsteps.  He followed and
called after her, but no answer came.  He went to
the entrance of the cavern and peered in, but saw
nothing, nor did he now hear a sound, save the echo
of his own voice when he mentioned her name.
</p>

<p>
He thought she had taken her courage in her hand,
doing so in desperation, and knowing the place
by this time, she must be making her way towards
his home.  Perhaps by this time she was close on
the chamber where Tyndale had been hiding.
</p>

<p>
With this conviction he turned away, bent on
overtaking and out-distancing the fiery-spirited
Inquisitor.
</p>

<p>
He did not know that when Margaret had gone
from him, her courage failed her as she thought of
the place where those grim skeletons were lying.
She was afraid to venture.  She shivered at the
thought; for, although she knew of the lantern,
ready to be lit with the tinder-box at hand, she felt
that she could not go through the cavern by herself.
Rather than do that she would stay the long night
near the river, taking whatever risks there were;
for what men might threaten did not seem so terrible
as the confrontation with that solemn silence
which spoke so awesomely of a tragedy of bygone
years.
</p>

<p>
At the entrance to the cavern her courage was
still less, so that she crouched in the darkness of the
bush and waited.  She was wanting some sign that
Herman was on his way, but instead she heard his
feet thud on the grass not far away, as though he was
following her.  Then she heard his quick breathing,
and marked how he halted.  Although she could
not see him, since, like herself, he was in the black
shadows of the bush, she guessed what he was doing&mdash;that
he was bending down to peer into the cavern.
</p>

<p>
His call came, but she remained still, scarcely
breathing lest he should hear her.  Then, when she
found it so hard to be silent that she must betray
herself, he went away.
</p>

<p>
She came from behind the bush, but could not see
him.  She could only hear his footsteps growing less
and less distinct.  He was going swiftly to make up
for lost time, and she was relieved.
</p>

<p>
Standing farther out in the open, away from the
entrance, she heard the faint thud of a man's feet
on the sod, and fainter yet, and fainter still.  Then
silence, with only the sounds of the river, the sigh of
the water among the rushes, the occasional hoot of
an owl, the slight swish of the wind on the grass
and among the trees, and the movement of some
belated creature wandering from his lair in search
of food.
</p>

<p>
The sense of loneliness disturbed her.  To be
here, in the meadow, with the black river on one
hand, the stretch of dark country on the other, and,
where the watchmen were on the city wall, some
challenge coming, making the loneliness seem the
greater.
</p>

<p>
The feeling sent her to her knees, crouching lower
and lower; but another thought swept through
her mind.  A man of God was being hunted.  The
hunter of heretics was after him.  Her lover was on
the path, seeking to save him.  Could she not pray?
Was not that the recourse for anyone in need?
</p>

<p>
She rose from the crouching posture until she
was fairly on her knees, and with her hands clasped,
she prayed for the hunted one.  She thought it no
shame to pray that the hunters should be undone,
that they might fall on some stumbling stone and
be broken.  She prayed that Herman might speed
well on his errand of warning.
</p>

<p>
How long she prayed she did not know.  There
was no reckoning of time in those moments of
pleading, for the thing that mattered was, that the
prayer should be heard by Him who sat on the
Mercy Seat.
</p>

<p>
She got up from her knees and moved slowly
towards the entrance, for she must go home.  But
her courage failed, just as it had done before.  She
crept into the place in something like desperation,
lit the lantern, and essayed to go forward.
</p>

<p>
She went haltingly, her heart beating wildly.
She could hear the sound of its throbbing.  Then, to
her alarm, something came like a cry through the
silence&mdash;a cry that must be from those still lips
away to her left.
</p>

<p>
She held up her lantern high, so that the light
should the better lessen the darkness, but it showed
her that grim forbidding heap on the cavern floor.
</p>

<p>
What was there to fear? she asked; yet she knew
it to be the dread of the intangible which was so
overwhelming, following on the strain of so much
anxiety when Cochlaeus was searching her father's
house, and after that the further mental tension of
watching for Tyndale's escape when he appeared
to be hemmed in with danger.  To her excited
imagination, after such a day, the cavern was peopled
with horrors.  Her mind was under compulsion to
think of the dead bodies close by her&mdash;to conjure
up a story of unspeakable suffering, isolation,
hunger, deadly fear, and the terror of the coming of
the tormentors.
</p>

<p>
She thought of this while standing in the open
space, one hand holding the lantern high, the other
on her bosom to still the wild beating of her heart.
Then came the sound of voices, and a cry which was
like a challenge, all coming as a jar to her being.
</p>

<p>
She did not know the voices, for they sounded
hollow and echoing in the ghostly place, having
something of menace in them.
</p>

<p>
The sounds came again.  Once more she heard
the challenge, and she could bear the strain no
longer.  The lantern fell from her hand and crashed
on the cavern floor, where the candle spluttered
and smoked the horny sides.  Her brain reeled.
In the diminished light she saw something moving,
she knew not what.  After that she fell beside the
lantern, and lay as one that was dead.
</p>

<p>
Who they were who came she did not know, nor
who they were who, a few moments later, stood
and gazed down at her, each one holding a lantern.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE NIGHT RIDE
</h3>

<p>
When Herman started on his errand his
thoughts were divided.  There was the
wish that he had insisted on seeing Margaret
safely through the cavern, if it had only
been to give her over to his mother's care.
</p>

<p>
He had accepted her ruling, for he realised the
fatal consequences if that sinister creature of the
Inquisition found Tyndale.  He thought of the
vessel going up the river, past the castles of robber
lords, and freighted with merchandise such as had
never gone up the stream before, since the bundles
of quarto sheets of the New Testament which Tyndale
was so laboriously translating into simple
English were in the hold.
</p>

<p>
Two things were fixed deeply in Herman's mind:
one that, come what would, Cochlaeus must not
come into touch with Tyndale; the other that his
late guest, now so honoured and so loved for his
gentle ways and godly life, must arrive in Worms,
where he would be comparatively safe, since that
city was in what Cochlaeus called "the full rage of
Lutheranism."  And Luther, too, was there.
</p>

<p>
The purpose was a spur to him, although with the
endurance of an athlete he went on and on.  He
was in feverish anxiety to go yet faster, and give
warning to the fugitive of the men who were after
him.
</p>

<p>
One thing he could not understand&mdash;that, fleet of
foot though he was, he went so far without
overtaking Cochlaeus and his companions.  Nor as he
went did he come across any sign of the <i>Marburg</i>.
</p>

<p>
With a cry of dismay he pulled up when he came
to a village on the river-bank.  In his absent-mindedness
for this long hour, thinking of so many things,
and not of the way he was taking, he had travelled
down the river, and every step had taken him farther
and farther from the man he was so eager to serve!
</p>

<p>
An hour lost!  Nay, two; for he would now
have those long miles to travel back before he
reached the point from whence he started, and only
then would the real endeavour commence.  Who
could tell what had chanced in the interval?
</p>

<p>
He did not waste a moment, but swung round
on the instant when he had discovered his blunder.
He roundly blamed himself for his stupidity, but
prayed that he might not be too late.
</p>

<p>
On he went, the speed growing greater as the
urgency swirled in on him.  He covered the ground
so swiftly that the hour he had lost was not doubled
when he came to the spot where Tyndale's hunters
had been talking.  He was bathed in perspiration,
for the return journey had been covered in little
more than half an hour.
</p>

<p>
Still, when he heard the city bell boom out the
hour, he knew that Cochlaeus and the others had
a lead of an hour and a half, and while he took off
his cap to wipe his face, he wondered whether he
could make up the loss and be in time.
</p>

<p>
The thought was like a whip to him, and he went
on with untiring speed, centring his mind on that
one purpose, to overtake Tyndale's pursuers.
</p>

<p>
He passed no one in that hard night's travel.
More than once he plunged through the woods
which ran down to the river's edge, where he found
himself in a darkness so dense that it seemed almost
Egyptian.  He had to go slowly then, only able to
guide himself by the scarcely distinguishable gleam
of the water; and more than once he sprawled
over a straggling root, and once again he struck
his head against an unseen branch which hung low
over the path.
</p>

<p>
The enforced slackening of speed was exasperating;
but he took things more calmly when he remembered
that Cochlaeus was in the same plight, and would
have to go as slowly.
</p>

<p>
When he came into the open country again he was
capless and bespattered with mud.  His doublet
was torn, and he felt the warm trickle of blood on
his cheek, where the jagged point of a broken branch
had grazed the skin.  But these were minor matters
where the thing at stake was of such overwhelming
importance.
</p>

<p>
By the time he had stepped clear of the forest
the heavy clouds had thinned away, and the moon,
while she did not altogether show her face, was
casting some blurred light on the path.  He was
able now to go forward with a more certain step,
so that he put on speed, and ran desperately, with
the energy of young manhood, careless of fatigue.
</p>

<p>
He passed a village which straggled towards the
river.  He wondered whether he should take a boat
and pass up the stream with it.  He would come
to the ship that way; but when he looked at the
waters, they were running strong, and the boats
that were moored at the landing-stage were heavy
ones.  He left them, and went on.
</p>

<p>
In one of the meadows were some horses, standing
idle, sleeping as they stood, but one awoke and
turned sleepily towards him.  The idea came that
he could force him into service.
</p>

<p>
He hesitated.  One might choose to call it robbery,
but God knew that it was no dishonest motive that
prompted him.  Against the temporary appropriation
of the horse was the life of a man whose service
to the world was of inestimable worth.  He could
take the horse for a few hours, and see that he was
returned.  He could give the messenger who took
the animal back a reasonable sum to pay for the
unconsented hire.
</p>

<p>
Yes.  He would do that.  It would help him to
make up the lost time through that stupid blunder
for which he mentally lashed himself again and again.
</p>

<p>
He went cautiously to where the horse was standing,
but he found himself in a difficulty at the outset.
His hand was on the sleepy creature's mane, and
then he realised that there was neither saddle nor
bridle.  As for the want of a saddle, that was
nothing to one who had ridden bareback scores of
times, but how was he to guide this silent and
perhaps docile creature, who was blinking at him
stupidly, wondering whether he was to be called
away from his well-earned leisure to some hard
night duty?
</p>

<p>
A suggestion came, and he acted on it.  There
was a long, thin lace scarf round his neck, and it
could be made to serve his purpose.  In a few
minutes his ingenuity produced a bridle and bit, all
in one, which would not put the horse to any
discomfort.  Then he sprang on the creature's back.
</p>

<p>
"On, good horse!" he cried, as he bent down to
gather up the loose ends of the scarf.  "God's good
man is in jeopardy, and many a blessing may be
lost to the world if you fail me to-night."
</p>

<p>
The horse moved forward, but with no great
willingness at first.  After a time, however, he
seemed affected with his rider's eagerness.  His
rest in the field had made him fit for service, and he
responded.  Before many minutes had passed he
was going quickly, then at a gallop in which he
stretched himself out whole-heartedly.
</p>

<p>
The moon still hid her face, but she threw out
sufficient light to show the way, and what was
round about.  As the horse raced onwards Herman's
spirit rose.  He began to think of possibilities.  As
yet he had seen no ship, nor any sign of one.  Nothing
was moving on the river but a small craft which
floated with the stream.  Nor had he seen those
men who were following the impatient lead of
Cochlaeus.  And yet it was of such supreme
importance that he should overtake them, and ride
beyond them.
</p>

<p>
After a time his heart leapt at the sight of a
company of men, and when he drove his horse
across a meadow to get so much nearer, he saw them
halt, as if to wait for the coming of this rider in the
night.
</p>

<p>
Suffering his horse to take his own pace, he bent
low as he passed the men, so that his face should
not be seen.  The moon rendered him just the right
service for those critical moments.  She showed
herself through a rift in a cloud for a moment or two,
and the light fell on the men.
</p>

<p>
He knew them all.  The Dean was one.  Four
others were soldiers of the City Guard, whom he
had seen constantly for years, in their frequent
perambulations through the streets, and their
halberds at this moment gleamed at the moon's
uncovering, but went dull again when the clouds moved
by, and the country and river were once more
wrapped in gloom.
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus was there, standing apart, trying to
intercept him, but Herman drew the horse aside.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-108"></a>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-108.jpg" alt="HERMAN DUG IN HIS HEELS AND THE HORSE GALLOPED PAST.">
<br>
HERMAN DUG IN HIS HEELS AND THE HORSE GALLOPED PAST.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" the man cried peremptorily, and held
out his hand to catch at the bridle, but Herman dug
in his heels, and the horse galloped past.  Who was
Cochlaeus, that he should exercise his authority
here, in the open meadows, far away from the
jurisdiction of the Burgomaster?
</p>

<p>
The horse plunged forward, and his hoofs
thundered on the path.  Herman turned to look
back.  The group was just as he had left it&mdash;a bunch
of men, and that one who stood aloof; but although
he could not see he supposed that they were gazing
after him angrily, because he had treated Cochlaeus
so cavalierly.
</p>

<p>
On went the horse, and Herman was elated at the
thought that he had stolen a march on the men
who were in pursuit of William Tyndale.  At the
pace the horse was travelling he would overtake the
<i>Marburg</i> and give his warning.  The captain would
surely do something then to get his passenger away,
if by any chance it became necessary.
</p>

<p>
While the horse galloped on, taking the path
along the river-bank as though the rush through the
night air was welcome after a spell of rest, Herman
thought out a plan which would mean safety for
Tyndale.  All his desire now was to overtake the
ship, get on board in some way&mdash;by swimming, if
in no other manner&mdash;tell his story, and then follow
out this idea of his.  He knew of a charcoal burner's
hut on the other side of the river, hidden away
in the forest, and there, with Roye to help him,
Tyndale could pursue his task, the amanuensis
writing while the scholar slowly dictated his
translation.  The printing-press could do its part later,
but at all events Tyndale's great work could go on.
</p>

<p>
The horse galloped on for three or four miles
more, and then the moon was out again, and made
the river look like a broad ribbon of silver winding
in and out amid the forests and the low-lying
meadows.
</p>

<p>
A shout of gladness came when Herman saw
a great black object on the water, which, as he
drew nearer, proved to be a ship beating up the
stream, her dark sails bellying in the wind.
Was it the <i>Marburg</i>?
</p>

<p>
He lost sight of her presently, for a forest came in
between.  He slackened the pace and rode into the
thicket, able to see the way because of the clear
shining of the moon, so that he took the zigzag path,
moving round the clumps of brushwood, avoiding
the hollows, and going carefully where the straggling
roots and heavy undergrowth made any progress
treacherous.
</p>

<p>
He had at last to dismount and lead the horse,
feeling his way almost in places, going at times at
little more than a snail's pace, the horse snorting
and breathing heavily with his long run.
</p>

<p>
Then the forest ended.
</p>

<p>
Standing still to gaze around ere he ventured into
the broad moonlight, because he heard voices and the
jingle of steel, Herman saw a broad sweep of grass
which stretched from the river up a steep slope,
until it came to the spot where this <i>cul-de-sac</i> of
green terminated in the closing up of the forest.  A
great castle was standing there, grey and forbidding
in the moonlight.  On the other side of the broad
grass incline was dense forest again, and Herman
meant to cross to it.  But on this wide strip of
open grass soldiers were moving towards the river
swiftly, their swords and steel breastplates gleaming
in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Herman dropped back, for the presence of the
fighting men boded evil to any whom they saw who
did not belong to the lord of this domain.  Many
a castle on this river was the hold of a robber
chieftain who preyed on the travellers on land or water,
demanding tribute and often holding his prisoners
to ransom.
</p>

<p>
Herman took his tired horse back into the darkness
of the forest, and, fastening him in a hollow
where he could not be seen, returned to the slope
again, to watch the glade and see when it would be
safe to move to the other side.
</p>

<p>
For a time he could see nothing of what was
happening on the river, but he was full of
apprehension when he thought that the soldiers were
bent on piracy.  By this time the <i>Marburg</i> must
have passed the landing-stage of the castle, and in
that case would be safe, unless&mdash;and there he halted
in his hope, and went cold with fear.  Suppose that
men had been placed on the watch, and, seeing the
<i>Marburg</i> labouring up the river against the stream,
had gone out in a boat to stop her, on the pretence
of levying tribute, while a messenger raced up the
slope to the robber stronghold to bring down the
lord with his fighting men!
</p>

<p>
The consequences were too well known to anyone
who lived within sight of the river, and this particular
castle was often spoken of&mdash;was common talk,
indeed, in the city.  The ship would be gone through
and robbed, if the captain and the crew were not
armed and ready to make a fight for it.  And
William Tyndale, known, perhaps, would be carried
to the castle, to be dealt with just as the wine-drinking
and blasphemous master of the castle might
choose.
</p>

<p>
It was natural to suppose the worst, and to
suppose the worst was to anticipate what was
most probable.  Ribaldry would be the slightest of
Tyndale's troubles.  Torment was next to
certainty.  It might be that the lord of the castle,
knowing how the Inquisitors would crave to have
the Englishman in their hands, would sell him to
them, if they paid a big price.
</p>

<p>
Herman thought of this.  Then it dawned on
him that he was thinking the worst while Tyndale's
vessel might have stolen by when the moon was
hidden, and by this time be far up the river, away
from this robber lord's influence.
</p>

<p>
He stole in and out among the trees towards the
river, careful not to be seen, and then his worst
fears were realised.  The <i>Marburg</i> was in
mid-stream, and about her were a score of boats, out of
which armed men were swarming on to her deck.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
THE PRISONER
</h3>

<p>
Herman's hand involuntarily closed over
the dagger at his belt, but he realised his
helplessness.
</p>

<p>
He could do nothing, for here, or within
call, moving up or down the slope, and out on the
waters, playing a pirate part, were scores of men,
all armed&mdash;men whose business it was to fight, and
who, if he had gone forth to make any remonstrance,
would drive their swords into him, and laugh at his
mad venture.  They would do it as the natural act
when one had the impudence or imprudence to
confront scores who knew no law but what the lord
of the castle cared to make.
</p>

<p>
He watched the strange scene on the river, and
from where he stood, compelled to be silent, but
with a feeling of dread, he saw, in the full flood of
moonlight, that the armed men were in possession
of the ship.  On the upper deck a man's body hung
over the handrail.  The man was either dead or
badly wounded.  That was the only token that
there had been resistance to these river pirates, for
the sailors, unarmed, and only a handful against
scores of trained fighters, had realised how futile it
was to endeavour to save the ship.
</p>

<p>
The crew were driven into a corner of the deck,
and held there like penned sheep by a few soldiers
whose breastplates glanced in the moonlight every
time they moved.  They were ready to cut down
any sailor who was mad enough to attempt to break
away.
</p>

<p>
Herman's teeth chattered, although the night
was warm, for the thought of William Tyndale's
extremity sent an icy shiver down his spine.  All
the bold effort to get the good man away had come
to naught.  There was the deadly fear of what
might follow, added to the bitterness of a
frustrated plan and the thought that God's Word was
not to reach the people of England after all.
</p>

<p>
He resolved to do whatever remained possible.
He would wait and see what was done to Tyndale&mdash;where
he might be placed by the robber lord.  Then
to his alert mind came the thought that he might
even yet be able to get Tyndale away.  But how, or
what the way might be, only the good God could
tell.
</p>

<p>
There was no sound of fighting.  Instead, the
laughter of the soldiers came over the waters.
Their steel helmets bobbed here and there, and
Herman knew that the men were searching the ship
for anything in the way of booty&mdash;money or goods.
</p>

<p>
Presently the first things came in the shape of
bales, possibly of silks, which were dropped over the
side into the boats.  Other bundles followed, but
only what was of value, for these soldiers were
experienced pillagers who spent their days and nights
in this sort of work.  They knew what things were
of worth, and what the lord of the castle would
be able to turn into gold.  Boat-load after boat-load
came to the bank, the booty was handed out to
men on the bank, and the boats returned for more.
</p>

<p>
Herman was startled by a sound on his right
hand, and, looking round quickly, he saw half a
dozen men emerge from among the trees and stand
out clear in the moonlight.  He saw the
newcomers' faces, and he dropped back farther into the
shades of the forest, for one of them was Cochlaeus.
</p>

<p>
For a while these men gazed on the unexpected
scene, and Herman, watching, saw how the face
of the heretic hunter worked with passion&mdash;the
fury of a man who thought he had but to overtake
the ship, and ask for Tyndale, and he would
have him in his power, but now discovered that the
Englishman was beyond his reach.
</p>

<p>
They were near enough for Herman to hear what
was said.
</p>

<p>
"Is this Schouts' place?" Cochlaeus asked,
pointing towards the castle, and speaking in hoarse
and passionate tones.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the Dean; "so that there is danger
for us as well as for those who are on board the
ship."
</p>

<p>
"Danger for us?" exclaimed Cochlaeus, in
amazement.  "Danger for me, an emissary of the
Church?"
</p>

<p>
"Schouts cares no more for the Church than for
the meanest man on board the <i>Marburg</i>.  He has
no fear for God or man."
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus gazed at him incredulously, and when
the Dean and the others drew back among the
trees, he stood clear out in the moonlight and
waved his clenched fists, in the impotence of his
disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"Come back!" the Dean exclaimed, fearful lest
this man might do something yet more rash, if he
had not already betrayed their presence by his mad
gestures.  "You do not know this robber lord.  He
would flout you or the Lord Cardinal, anything and
anybody that belongs to the Church, as readily as
he would beat down one of his own soldiers who
dared to disobey him!"
</p>

<p>
The Dean stepped forward, and, with a strong
grip on the Churchman's arm, drew him away
forcibly among the trees.
</p>

<p>
"I pray God we were not seen," Herman heard
the Dean say.
</p>

<p>
What Cochlaeus and his companions did after
that Herman could not tell, but as time went on,
and he heard no sound to indicate their presence,
and saw no more of them, he concluded that they
had gone back.
</p>

<p>
Convinced that this was so, he watched for
Tyndale, wondering whether the robber lord would
only concern himself with booty and let the men
on board alone.
</p>

<p>
The boats went to and fro, until the <i>Marburg's</i>
hold must have been emptied of all that was worth
carrying away; and now Herman was eager to
know what would follow.  The man whose body
had been hanging over the handrail began to revive,
and he staggered over to a coil of rope on which he
sat with evident pain.  He was apparently waiting
for the worst.  The moonlight falling on the face
made Herman aware that it was the captain of the
ship.
</p>

<p>
Someone went to him&mdash;a tall man, clothed in the
garb of a nobleman, and giving one the impression
of immensity.  He must have been Schouts, the
predatory lord of whom the Dean had spoken.
The captain lifted his face as if to answer a question,
and it was crumpled and lined with pain, and
ghostly in its paleness; and even while Schouts
was speaking, he fell sideways, and lay on the deck
like one who was dead.
</p>

<p>
The other swung round on his heel after gazing
at the prostrate man for a few moments, and, tramping
along the deck, moved down the ladder into the
waist of the <i>Marburg</i>.  Before many minutes had
passed a man's loud voice rang out, and the soldiers
on board began to search in obscure places for
something.
</p>

<p>
Were they looking for Tyndale?
</p>

<p>
The unspoken question was answered quickly.
Two men came along the lower deck, and between
them walked a bearded man.
</p>

<p>
It was William Tyndale.
</p>

<p>
He did not walk cravenly, although he moved
slowly and with bowed head.  The soldiers, with
their swords drawn, took him to Schouts, whose
weapon-point rested on the deck.  Something was
said, although Herman heard no sound of voices,
and the robber lord, turning his back on his prisoner,
walked to the ship's side, the prisoner following.
One by one the men came down the rope-ladder into
a boat, Schouts first, then Tyndale, and after him
the two soldiers.  As soon as they were seated, the
boat was pulled to the landing-place.
</p>

<p>
Herman hurried to the spot where he had stood
for his first glimpse of the grass slope.  It was in
his mind that he might see Tyndale more closely,
and who could tell whether, in God's mercy,
something might happen whereby he might effect his
escape?  It was a wild hope, but he did not set it
aside.
</p>

<p>
He passed the hollow where the horse stood
quietly and tiredly, and reached the place just as
Tyndale made his way among the heaps of pirated
merchandise.  There were half a score of armed
retainers about him now, and the hope of rescue
passed.
</p>

<p>
Looking out on the river, while Tyndale was kept
standing to wait for further commands, Herman
saw the sailors moving away from the spot where
they had been penned in by the soldiers.  He heard
the sound of the winch, as they slowly raised the
anchor which had been dropped on Schouts' demand,
and before long the sails were bellying in the wind,
and the ship moved up the stream.
</p>

<p>
A call came on the night air, and the company, of
which Tyndale was the centre, began to move.  He
came slowly, as though he were ill, but the soldiers,
apparently realising this, suited their pace to his.
Schouts moved up the slope without waiting, but
halted close to where Herman stood, to call back
to the men to begin to carry the spoil to the
castle.
</p>

<p>
Tyndale drew level with Herman's standing spot,
and, scarce knowing why, the young man went in
and out among the trees and bushes, anxious to
watch the prisoner.  It was a perilous venture, for
a false step might cause him to make some sound,
and the captain of Tyndale's guard, expecting an
attack, might send some of his men into the forest
to search.  It could scarcely mean less than death
if they found him, and what excuse could he make
but this, that, having occasion to pass on through
the forest, he had found his way barred by the
soldiers?  They would laugh his explanation to
scorn, perhaps, and run him through with a
sword or carry him to one of the dungeons in the
castle.
</p>

<p>
The castle gate was reached at last.  The drawbridge
was already down, but the portcullis had to
be raised before any of the party could pass in.
Herman so stood that as the moonlight fell on the
face of the prisoner he saw how he cast a wistful
look around him, as though this might be the last
he would ever have beneath God's open heavens.
Hopelessness, too, so Herman thought, was on the
tired man's face, and the traces of bitter
disappointment because the work on which he had been
engaged might never be completed.
</p>

<p>
When Tyndale stood at the drawbridge, waiting
for it to be raised, Herman heard sounds behind
him, like the stealthy movements of men, and
felt alarmed for his own safety.  But another idea
came.  Was it possible that some were approaching
with the intention of attempting Tyndale's rescue?
But who would be so mad when, at the clangour of
the castle bell, a hundred armed men would be
on the spot?
</p>

<p>
Knowing that he could not be seen, he waited to
discover the meaning of these movements, and
what he saw surprised him.  One man took his
place behind a tree not more than half a dozen
yards away.  Another drew away from a bush and
stood beside the first comer.  Others crept up from
the dark shadows, but not so near, within call, but
standing well out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"That is Tyndale," Herman heard one say, and
the voice belonged to Cochlaeus.
</p>

<p>
The voice of the other who answered was the
Dean's.
</p>

<p>
"Then if he crosses the drawbridge, and the
portcullis falls, Tyndale goes out of your power.
But let him go!  Now that Schouts has him in
his robber den he is as good as dead.  God alone
knows what he may do to silence him, for I count
Schouts equal to anything.  You have but to think
of the man to know that he is barbarity personified."
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus spoke back in low tones which vibrated
with exasperation.
</p>

<p>
"What care I for that?  We want this fellow,
Tyndale, in our own hands.  We can only feel safe
to know that he is in our care, and that, when the
torture he deserves is over, we shall effectually
silence him.  For ever!" Cochlaeus added,
almost aloud, in his virulent hate of the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
He dropped into silence when the Dean spoke
sharply at his rashness in speaking for a hundred
ears might catch any sound in the still night.
</p>

<p>
The portcullis rose when the drawbridge dropped,
and the gate was already open.  A moment's pause
followed, before a word came from the captain of
the guard, and the soldiers, springing from inertness
into full attention, moved across the bridge with
their prisoner.  Before many moments had passed
Tyndale had gone out of sight.
</p>

<p>
There was a hollow sound of tramping on stone
inside, another command, and before the footsteps
died away the gate was closed with a heavy clang,
and the portcullis dropped.
</p>

<p>
Tyndale was shut up in the castle.  But to what?
Was it to death?
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
THE FOREST RANGER
</h3>

<p>
Herman stood in silence far on into the
night.  He watched the soldiers pass by
continually on the grass slope, and saw as
well a little army of retainers go down
to the river to help in bringing up the goods that
had been taken from the <i>Marburg</i>.  He was eager to
know whether among the booty brought up to the
castle any of Tyndale's bales of printed sheets were
there, for, if so, then all the toil of those past weeks
had gone for nothing.  The last load passed over
the drawbridge, the portcullis dropped as the last
man entered the gate, and then silence followed.
</p>

<p>
Herman had missed nothing, and he breathed
with intense relief when he found that no such
load had been carried into the robber's stronghold.
On that count, indeed, Tyndale was not the loser.
</p>

<p>
But more important still was the fate of the
prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Herman watched the castle walls as they stood
there, grey and grim in the moonlight.  The feeling
grew upon him that Tyndale's position was a hopeless
one, for this stronghold was impregnable, a death-trap
from whence no prisoner could hope to escape.
The towers and curtains bristled with gleaming
lances and polished helmets of fighting men.  What
chance, then, was there for rescue or escape for
anyone shut up in the stronghold of that robber noble
who feared neither God nor man, who scouted all
human laws, and laughed&mdash;so common rumour had
it&mdash;at the bare suggestion of mercy?
</p>

<p>
Herman was puzzled to know what a man like
Schouts meant to do with Tyndale, and why he
had singled him out while all others on board the
<i>Marburg</i> were allowed to go free.  The Reformer's
religion could have no weight with him, for he
was known all the country round to scoff at anything
religious, and heresy was no more obnoxious to him
than the extremest orthodoxy.  It was impossible
that the master of the robber den had any care,
or even any hate, for the Protestantism that was
causing so much controversy in Europe.
</p>

<p>
Could it be possible that Schouts thought to hold
Tyndale for ransom?  He was too poor to find two
or three hundred pieces of silver, leave alone as many
golden crowns, before he would be allowed to go free.
Herman knew how poor he was.  If he told his
story to the lord of the castle, it would be the same
story he had told in Herman's home&mdash;that he was
possessed of nothing, that his poverty was like
the Saviour's who had no home wherein at night
to rest His tired head.  The money on which he
lived, and with which he paid for the printing of
his Bible, was not his own.  He was being supplied
with it by some godly English merchants who,
caring a great deal for the so-called "new learning,"
were placing the means within the scholar's reach,
enabling him to live without want while he
translated the Scriptures into the English tongue.
</p>

<p>
With money in some shape or form, as the one
great want of this notorious bandit, Schouts would
scorn the thought of counting William Tyndale a
prize, who could at the most give him, when he
surrendered all he had, a few gold pieces.
Herman sat on the trunk of a fallen pine tree, and,
burying his face in his hands, tried to think out
this incomprehensible thing, that Schouts should
think it worth his while to hold William Tyndale
as a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
He was puzzling his brain over this when he
heard some sounds behind him, as of someone
moving about among the trees.  A deadly fear
swept through him, and, putting his hand to his
belt, he gripped the handle of his dagger.  It might
be some wild beast prowling, getting at the horse,
perhaps, or coming for himself.  Or it might be one
of Schouts' men, who would run him through if he
saw him, or raise a loud outcry, bringing soldiers
out of the castle to carry him there as a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
He sat in silence, in statuesque stillness, scarce
breathing.  The darkness where he was, was dense;
but he felt perturbed when he thought that the
moon in the open would show him, silhouetted, as
it were, to anyone behind him.
</p>

<p>
The sounds went on, always in stealth, and they
drew so much nearer that he knew it was someone
human, and not a prowling beast.  Herman's
impulse was to challenge the man, whoever he might
be, but he thought it well to be silent and not betray
his presence.  After a while, sitting with his dagger
drawn, ready for any onslaught, he knew from the
sounds that the man was moving away towards the
castle.
</p>

<p>
He breathed more freely at the thought, for the
man had other things in his mind.  Unexpectedly
the stranger stepped a little into the open, where
the moonlight cast his shadow on the grass, and an
exclamation of amazement sprang from Herman's
lips.
</p>

<p>
"Roye!" he said, in subdued tone, just loud
enough for his voice to carry to the man who stood
gazing at the castle.
</p>

<p>
Roye started at the unexpected call, and dropped
back among the trees.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?" he exclaimed, in a tone which
betrayed his anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Herman Bengel.  I am here."
</p>

<p>
A moment later he had sprung from his seat and
was trampling among the brushwood, the low-hanging
branches of the trees rustling as his body
swept against them.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Master Tyndale?" Roye asked,
the moment they met in the darkness, where they
barely saw each other's form.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He was taken into the castle.  But why
should the robber lord take him there, a prisoner,
more than any other on board the <i>Marburg</i>?
Yourself, for example?" Herman asked in a puzzled
tone.  He scarcely paused, for another thought had
come.
</p>

<p>
"It could never be that the robber lord had some
inkling that Master Tyndale was on board that ship
and was thinking to carry him away to some safe
place, just as was done once with Doctor Martin
Luther, to hide him from his enemies."
</p>

<p>
It was a new idea.  There was something like
hopefulness in Herman's soul when he considered the
possibility, but the hope was dashed at once when
Roye spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Would God it were so.  But this man, this
bandit lord, I heard the sailors say, when they were
speaking about him as we were beating up the river,
has no fear of God in his heart.  He scoffs as much
at the Reformers as he does at the Catholics.  The
idea is to sell my master to the tormentors if they
will pay the price."
</p>

<p>
"God forbid!" Herman cried, smitten with
horror at the thought.  "It cannot be!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked Roye.  "Others have done
it.  The Inquisitors have bought the prisoners in
these bandit castles by the score, paying big sums
of money for them, to have the opportunity of
dealing with them in the torture chambers of what
they call their Holy Houses.  Schouts must have
heard that Master Tyndale is badly wanted, and he
believes he has a prize."
</p>

<p>
They stood and talked in whispers.  At odd
times some creature slunk past them into the forest
depths, out of their way; but nothing human came
near them.  Feeling oppressed with the hopelessness
of the position, they turned back into the
forest, Herman leading the way to the hollow where
the horse was tethered.  Their idea was to go back
to the city and tell the story of this disaster.
</p>

<p>
After a while they felt the stress of hunger, and,
seeing a light down one of the forest avenues, they
went towards it and found a hut, from the window of
which the light was streaming.
</p>

<p>
"Who goes there?" came the cry when Herman
knocked loudly on the door; then someone passed
the window, and Herman, seeing the face, knew him.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Otto Engel!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"What if it be?" was the man's half-menacing
answer, for he heard the words.  "I asked who was
there, not who was I!"
</p>

<p>
"I am Herman Bengel."
</p>

<p>
"What?" was the incredulous response.  "Out
in the forest at this time o' night?  What art doing
here?"
</p>

<p>
"Knocking at Otto Engel's door, to ask if he will
sell two hungry men some food."
</p>

<p>
The ranger laughed.
</p>

<p>
"That's good! to come to a friend to buy a
meal!"
</p>

<p>
By this time the bolt was drawn and the bar
dropped, and now the ranger filled up the open
doorway, a giant, so he seemed, by contrast, even to those
outside, who were both beyond the average size.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" he cried, drawing back to make room
for them to enter, and thus allowing the light to fall
on the faces of his visitors.
</p>

<p>
"One is Herman Bengel.  I know that much,"
he said, as they passed into the hut.  "But who
is the other?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you when the door is shut," Herman
said in a low tone.  "It is not well to shout a man's
name, nor even whisper it&mdash;not this man's, at all
events, even in the depths of the forest."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! some criminal escaped from jail, and you
think to bring him here for me to hide him?" the
ranger said jestingly, to tease Herman.
</p>

<p>
"Just as you will.  But can you lodge this horse?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Come this way," was the hearty answer.
Laying a hand on the queer bridle, but saying
nothing, he led the horse to the other side of the hut,
where he placed him in a snug stable and gave the
tired creature a plentiful supply of food and water.
</p>

<p>
Before long the two men were sitting to a meal
which Engel set before them, so appetising that in
spite of their anxiety they ate with keen relish, the
ranger plying them with food till they could eat no
more.
</p>

<p>
"Now for this story&mdash;the reason why two men
should be out in the forest at this time o' night,"
the ranger said, when he had cleared the table.
</p>

<p>
Herman gazed about him before he answered.
He got up from his stool and walked round the hut,
looking into the corners, and opening an inner door
to assure himself that no others but themselves were
there.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody's here, Herman," said Otto Engel,
who was watching his movements, and guessed his
purpose.  "I live here all alone.  I've neither wife
nor child, more's the pity!" he added sadly.
"Those creatures from the Holy House in your city
came out here one day, and took my wife.  And the
little one pined away, and her mother never came
back."
</p>

<p>
The big man clenched his fist, and brought it down
with a resounding blow on the table, so that the
flagon, which held the Rhenish wine, and the horn
cups danced.  His face flushed, not so much with
anger and hate&mdash;though both were there&mdash;but with
grief and the yearning for revenge if an opportunity
ever came his way.  Herman thought, as he gazed at
him, that if any of those Familiars of the Inquisition
ventured into his hut, though he were alone, and
they were two or more, they would never leave the
place alive.
</p>

<p>
"What brings you here, Herman?" Engel asked,
more quietly, when the tempestuous passion had
gone; but his hand trembled as the fist, still clenched,
rested on the table, and his face twitched with
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"William Tyndale is the cause of our being here
to-night," Herman said, returning to his stool again,
satisfied now that he could speak as freely as he
pleased.
</p>

<p>
"Tyndale?" cried Engel, his face full of surprise.
"Do you mean the Englishman?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'll tell you all about it, Engel."
</p>

<p>
Herman told the story from the day when he and
Margaret met the tired traveller in the meadow,
down to the capture of the <i>Marburg</i> a few hours
before.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all?" Engel asked, having listened with
parted lips.
</p>

<p>
"All?  Isn't it enough?" exclaimed Herman.
</p>

<p>
Silence followed.  Each man was busy with his
thoughts&mdash;Herman and Roye wondering how far
their dread concerning William Tyndale might
become a certainty, and the prisoner should be
handed over to the tormentors; Otto Engel ruminating
on the memory that never left him, but wondering
as well what he could do to set the man free who
was daring so much for the world's uplifting.
</p>

<p>
Herman had not mentioned his and Roye's fears
as to what Schouts would do with his prisoner, but
Engel's own thoughts had travelled in that direction.
</p>

<p>
"My lord, in the robber's castle yonder, will make
a pot o' money out of William Tyndale!" he
exclaimed, breaking the long silence, and jerking his
thumb over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked Herman, startled at the thought
that their fears were likely to become a reality.
</p>

<p>
"How?  This Cochlaeus will offer Schouts a big
sum, and the two will haggle over terms.  Perhaps
they'll spend days in making offers and rejecting
them; but I can see the end as plainly as I see this
fist of mine.  The Inquisitors will get William
Tyndale into their toils, while Schouts will get his
price.  Don't I know?"
</p>

<p>
Silence followed again, save for the sounds of the
sleeping dog on the hearth, who barked in his
dreams, and the blazing and crackling of the
pine-log fire.
</p>

<p>
"I will spoil their wicked game for them!" the
ranger exclaimed presently, shifting his great feet
and turning away to the fire, so that the blaze of it
lit up his face, usually so ruddy, but now pale, yet full
of determination.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" the others cried in their
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"What I said," came the answer almost curtly.
"I'll spoil their wicked game for them."
</p>

<p>
"How?" cried Roye, coming to the ranger and
laying a trembling hand on his shoulder.  "In
God's dear name, Otto Engel, tell us what you
mean," he went on eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I scarcely know."
</p>

<p>
The answer came in a tone which showed how
greatly perturbed he was.
</p>

<p>
"I must have time to think.  I must sleep on it,
and then, please God, we will do something.  Go and
lie down yonder, both of you, for we'll want some
quick brains to puzzle this thing out.  It will take
some thinking to frustrate a man like Cochlaeus,
but we'll do it.  We'll spoil their wicked game for
them, and we'll cheat the robber lord somehow."
</p>

<p>
Engel waited to say no more.  Blowing out the
lamp, so that the only light inside the hut came from
the flickering flames of the fire, he threw himself on
the hearth after a brief and silent prayer; and as if
he only had to will it, he went off into a heavy sleep.
The others followed his example, lying on the bed of
leaves in the corner, and before long all were asleep in
the ranger's hut.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
A DARING DECISION
</h3>

<p>
The sun had been up for some time before any
of the sleepers began to stir, and when
Otto Engel stretched himself and yawned,
and, doing so, awoke the others, he had no
sense of shame for being a laggard with the day so
far run on.  It was his custom to sleep away so many
of the hours of daylight, for he was very much of
what he called himself&mdash;a night-bird, who must
needs walk about his business while the world was
sleeping.  That night wandering was a part of his
duty as ranger of the forest.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get you some breakfast," was his first word,
when Herman sat up and stared around, wondering
where he was; and before long the three men and
the dog were eating what for two of them was a late
morning meal.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'll find my way home," said Herman,
who was depressed and ate but sparingly.  Roye,
too, sat playing absent-mindedly with his bread.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, you must stay here to-day, if anything is to
be done to help William Tyndale," the ranger cried,
tossing down his knife and wiping his mouth with the
back of his hand, while he shifted back his stool to
cross his knee.
</p>

<p>
"How can we help Master Tyndale?" Roye asked
gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you before the day is gone; but the
thing wants a deal of consideration.  If you care to
stay, you are more than welcome, and, what is more
to the point, your assistance will be valuable.
Whatever I may decide, I won't be able to do
anything single-handed.  I know that much, so that
William Tyndale's largely in your hands."
</p>

<p>
Herman watched the stalwart forester.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think is possible?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know any more than the man in the
moon, as people say.  I shall have to think the thing
out.  My real idea is to get William Tyndale out of
the hands of Schouts, if you must know, and cheat
Cochlaeus as well.  So now you know.
</p>

<p>
"Lie by, and don't show yourselves," he added,
looking to his belt to see that he had his weapons
there.
</p>

<p>
By this time Engel was standing at the door, with
the dog at his heels ready for duty with his master.
"When I have thought this thing well through I
will come back and talk it over with you.  It may
be a couple of hours.  It may be a great deal more.
But I'll come, and if you are here, so much the better.
Burn it into your mind, Herman Bengel, and you,
William Roye, that we are going to get Master
Tyndale out of that devil's den."
</p>

<p>
He went out, pulling the door after him noisily,
and walked down the foot-beaten track.  He halted
before he had gone many yards, and, returning,
opened the door again.
</p>

<p>
"Help yourselves to food when you feel hungry,"
he said, standing in the entrance with his hand on
the latch.  "There's no need for stint, since the
larder's full enough.  I may be away some time,
for, if you don't mind, I'll take that horse back, and
set him adrift in the field where you found him.  It
would be awkward for me if they found him in my
stable.  Shall I do that?"
</p>

<p>
Herman nodded.
</p>

<p>
The forester had more to say.
</p>

<p>
"Put the bolts in the door to keep intruders out.
I don't want any of my friends yonder to come and
find you here."  He jerked his thumb over his
shoulder towards the castle.  "They come sometimes
for a chat, and so I get to know things.  If
any of them come, keep quiet, and don't open the
door.  They'll think I'm on my rounds."
</p>

<p>
He stalked away to the stable, and Herman, as
soon as he saw him ride past the window on the
borrowed horse, drove in the bolt.
</p>

<p>
The hours went slowly, and to those who were
shut up in the forest hut, compelled to be idle, they
seemed interminable.  They talked over the possibilities
at which Otto Engel had hinted so confidently,
but in the slow passing of the hours they began to
grow hopeless over Tyndale's affairs.  They
speculated as to what the forester might be able to do,
but their own memory of the drawbridge and
portcullis, and the armed men on the walls, drove
them to the conclusion that his scheme was a wild
and impossible one.
</p>

<p>
Again and again Herman went to the window,
and looked out to the forest, hoping to see the
forester, but there was no sign of his coming.  He
saw the giant trees rearing their proud heads to
the sun, which at some spots found its way on
the pathways and undergrowth.  Some wild boars
rushed by at odd intervals, and a dark-grey, grizzled
lynx chased a poor creature among the branches, or
dropped to the earth on an unsuspecting victim.
It served to pass the time to watch from the window
all that went on in the forest&mdash;the wolves that
passed, or a bear that shambled along, but halted
at an ant-hill to scrape out the nests and lap up the
eggs.
</p>

<p>
But the all-absorbing matters were those two&mdash;the
rescue of William Tyndale, and Margaret, who
in less than a week was to be his wife.  He shivered
at the thought of her journey through the cavern,
with its loneliness and those tokens of death from
which she had shrunk even in his company.  What
must she have felt when she was moving in the
cavern alone?
</p>

<p>
The hours went on&mdash;the longest he had ever
spent.  The morning passed.  The sun changed his
position, and cast long, slanting shadows, and
presently the afternoon began to grow old.  Then
evening came, and the forester had not returned.
</p>

<p>
They began to be anxious for his safety, and
fears of many sorts were talked about.  Had he
shot some wild creature, and in the brute's agony
had he been mauled and torn?  The anxiety became
so great, when the shadows grew dense and
night was falling, that Herman drew the bolt,
intending to go out and search for the absent
man; but Roye, as much distressed, but cautious,
dissuaded him.
</p>

<p>
At last they heard the heavy stamp of feet on
the path outside, and then the scratch of a dog's
paws on the door.  Herman's hand went to the
bolt, but he waited for another sign, and when
Engel spoke quietly and lifted the latch he opened
the door.
</p>

<p>
"I put the horse back in the meadow!" the
forester exclaimed, lowering himself stiffly on a
stool, but he had barely done so when he straightened
himself and went to the cupboard to get food for
himself and the dog.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," cried Herman.  "I'll do that."
</p>

<p>
"I've got to the bottom of my scheme," said
the tired man, glad to be seated.  "I'll tell you all
about it as soon as I find myself in front of food.
But we'll see to the dog first," he added, the moment
Herman set the meat on the table.
</p>

<p>
"I've found a way for getting William Tyndale
out of that robber's den, so that we shall surprise
both Schouts and Cochlaeus, and spoil their plans!"
Otto Engel exclaimed, his mouth full.  He was
eating ravenously, for he and the dog had gone
all the day without food.  In his wanderings he
had threshed out that difficult problem of
deliverance.  "I can see my way, and we'll have him out
of it before I'm very much older," he added, when
he had swallowed a draught of water and had given
the dog another great helping.
</p>

<p>
"You can?" the others cried, startled by the
forester's words, and impressed with his confidence.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I can!" mumbled Engel, who seemed to
grow hungrier as the moments sped.
</p>

<p>
"And what's your plan?" asked Roye, drawing
his stool up to the table, where he leant forward
and gazed at the ranger.  "Is it sure?" he went
on, laying his hand on the other's arm.  "Or is it
possible that you may fail and leave us to our
disappointment, and my master to his death?"
</p>

<p>
His face was pale and his voice eager and tremulous,
while his eyes gleamed as though they were not far
from tears.
</p>

<p>
The ranger swallowed his mouthful, and then
he answered as earnestly as Roye:
</p>

<p>
"Neither of you shall be disappointed, please
God, if you choose to throw in your lot with me
and make this venture.  You will possibly say 'tis
a desperate thing to do.  You may even deem me
mad.  I know not what you may say or think when
I tell you what I mean to do.  God only knows
what you may say about it&mdash;that it is like putting
one's head into a noose if by any means the plan
should fail."
</p>

<p>
Engel's meal was ended now, and, getting up
from the table, he carried his stool with him and
sat before the fire, and sprawled his crossed feet to
catch the warmth of the burning logs.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose nine out of ten, not knowing what I
know, would say it was a madman's venture, but
I'll tell you exactly what is at the back of my mind,
and you shall say 'yes' or 'no,' according to what
you think, when I have had my say."
</p>

<p>
The others pulled their stools to the fireside and
listened; but while he unfolded his plan they
thought he must be mad.  Yet when they looked
at his face they felt they were mistaken.  He had
evidently planned the whole thing out, basing this
desperate scheme on his knowledge of the castle and
not on mere supposition.
</p>

<p>
They shrank from the venture which the forester
proposed, for there could be but one ending to it,
without benefiting William Tyndale in the slightest
degree.  On the very face of it, it was doomed to
failure, and it might end in death for them all.
</p>

<p>
"You are only telling us of the bare possibilities,
Otto!" Herman exclaimed, when the ranger had
ended.  "You surely do not mean that we shall
make such a wild attempt?"
</p>

<p>
The ranger swung round on his stool and faced
Herman, but did not speak until he once more
turned to gaze into the midst of the burning logs,
leaning forward as though he saw pictures among
them.
</p>

<p>
"I am telling you of something more than
possibilities," he said presently.  "I count what
I propose as a certainty, and I mean to try my plan.
I shall be glad to have you with me, but if you are
afraid&mdash;and it's not to be wondered at if you are&mdash;I
will do the thing alone; only the task will be so
much the harder, and the risks will be greater because
it will take so much longer time.  God helping me,
the man on whom so much depends shall be freed!"
</p>

<p>
Engel sprang to his feet, overturning the stool,
and paced the floor, walking round by the wall
and past the door and window like a caged beast,
back and forth again, as though to walk off his
excitement.
</p>

<p>
"I mean to try it!" he exclaimed.  "I've been
kneeling a lot to-day in the forest to pray about it,
and I believe God has shown me the way.  It would
be woe to me if I did not do my best for the good
man after that."
</p>

<p>
He was moving about restlessly, not pausing
while he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I can't imagine how you mean to get inside
the castle," Herman said, incredulous.  The scheme
was such a preposterous one.
</p>

<p>
Engel went to a cupboard on the farther side of
the room, and, feeling about in the darkness, he
brought out a sheet of paper, which he smoothed
out on the table.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get a light," he said, and when the candle
was burning he spoke again.  "You are both able
to lay some claim to scholarship, I suppose; so you
will understand this plan with a bit of explanation.
It's a plan of Schouts' castle, but he doesn't know
I've got it, or he might hang me over his gate."
</p>

<p>
He bent over the sheet when he had covered the
window, so that none might look in from outside.
Then, with his forefinger, while the others bent over,
he opened out the scheme more fully.  He showed
them the point where he would go in, where he
would go when he was once inside, and how he
meant to get out with William Tyndale, and the
others, with the plan so plainly before them, saw
that the scheme was possible, provided there were
no accidents to mar it.
</p>

<p>
But it was a desperate venture, to say the least,
for three men to pit themselves against the robber
lord, and expect to snatch their friend from the
clutches of one who had scores of servitors, every
one a trained fighting man who had no fear of God
or man, and, like the Norse warriors who had in
them the Berserker spirit, would go to the battle
when the call came, and fight with frenzied and
merciless fury.  The bare suggestion was little less
than madness.
</p>

<p>
After bending over the table so long, the forester
straightened himself and gazed down at the crumpled
sheet of paper which was resting on the table
among the crumbs and broken bread which had not
been swept away.  Herman and Roye glanced up
at him, and saw the resolute look on his face and
the total absence of fear.  The first to speak was
Herman.
</p>

<p>
"Otto Engel."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall go with you."
</p>

<p>
"So will I!" Roye exclaimed.  His pale face
showed that he did not speak lightly.
</p>

<p>
The ranger put out his hands and gripped those
which were stretched out to him.
</p>

<p>
"I counted on you both," he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"When shall we start?" Herman asked.
</p>

<p>
"Now."
</p>

<p>
Roye turned his back on the others and gazed
into the fire, but a few moments later he swung
round again.
</p>

<p>
"I said I would go, and so I will.  But 'tis too
great a venture without asking God's help before
we start," he said, dropping on his knees at the
table.  The others did the same, and buried their
faces in their hands while the elder man prayed
concerning this dangerous enterprise, and asked
that William Tyndale might have a safe deliverance.
</p>

<p>
"Now I can go in double strength," cried the
ranger, still on his knees; and there was something
exalted in his tone and a look on his face that is
rare with men.  "Please God, we'll have that dear
man here before the dawn comes!"
</p>

<p>
He rose to his feet, and, looking to his weapons,
bade the others do the same.  Telling the dog to
keep safe watch, however long they were away,
giving him a big bone to wile away the hours and
placing food within his reach in case the creature
should grow hungry, he blew out the light, threw
open the door, and walked into the night.
</p>

<p>
The moon was already showing her face in fitful
gleams where the leafy canopy of the forest was
broken here and there; but even thus it seemed
dark at first.  They moved in stealth, not knowing
who might be abroad.  Once they saw a pair of
shining eyes in the thicket, but at a sharp word
from the ranger and a menacing movement on his
part, the beast moved off, snarling, yet frightened,
for three men were too many to meet in fight.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas a wolf, and he's a desperate coward
when you get him in a corner," Engel said carelessly.
</p>

<p>
The slow going in the forest took more than half
an hour of their time, but at last they reached the
open, where the green slope swept, up which William
Tyndale had been taken, as a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
All was silent now, and the moonlit sweep of
grass had neither man nor beast on it.
</p>

<p>
Away to the left were the silver-shining waters of
the river, but it was clear.  No craft moved up or
down, and nothing tempted the bandit lord from
his warm banquet-hall.  Presently, however, Herman
and his companions caught the glint of steel,
and then they saw a soldier come from behind a
bush and pace the bank, doubtless on the look out
for any vessel that gave promise of plunder.
</p>

<p>
"Were it not for the trouble that would come,
I would go on my knees here and pray that some
craft might pass which would bring Schouts and
his cut-throat soldiers out to-night," the ranger
muttered.  "'Twould go some way towards lessening
our own danger."
</p>

<p>
"Many a poor man would lose his life to-night if
we prayed like that," said Roye seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That's the worst part of it.  One benefits
so often at the price of another's irremediable loss,"
came the ranger's grave response.  "Ah, well!
We'll take it as God sends it!"
</p>

<p>
He led the way along the edge of the ascending
slope, but well within the shadows of the trees.
</p>

<p>
The castle stood on the brow of the hill, and
those who were on this desperate errand saw the
massive towers and wondered how an enemy
could hope to scale the walls and capture the place.
Standing for a while, since there was ample time,
Engel told his companions what the castle was like
inside, so that they might not be altogether
unprepared for what they would see during their
venture.
</p>

<p>
"You pass the gateway which those two towers
defend.  Then you are in the first or lower ward,
which is defended by as many as eight strong
towers, and separated from the second ward by
another gateway with a portcullis.
</p>

<p>
"In the second ward is a dungeon tower and a
prison chapel, but William Tyndale is not in that
part of the castle.  I found out so much when I
was abroad to-day.  You go out of the second
ward by a long flight of steps to the third and
fourth wards, which are surrounded by a steep
rampart and a wall, I know not how many feet
thick, nor how many high.  Then you come to the
very heart of things.  There is the King's Tower,
where Schouts is lodged.  There's the Queen's
Tower, where his lady has her quarters.  The
kitchen and the chapel and other places are near.
Well, it's in the King's Tower we have to go, for
Master Tyndale is lodged there, and because I have
a friend in court, I know just where."
</p>

<p>
The ranger stopped talking abruptly.  They
were approaching a broad and open path which
ran through the forest, and they caught the sound
of men's voices.
</p>

<p>
Standing back where none could see them, they
waited, wondering at the meaning of these
unexpected sounds.  A minute or two later the lights
of lanterns appeared on their right in a dense part
of the forest.  These came nearer and nearer, and
not only were there the sounds of men's voices, but
of horses' hoofs, their snortings, and the jingle of
their trappings.
</p>

<p>
Before long a dozen horsemen moved past those
who were standing in the shelter of the bushes&mdash;two
men, fully armed, going first, their drawn swords
glancing as they rode out to the grassy slope.  Then
two others at whose sides swords hung in their
scabbards, and behind them a number of well-armed
men.
</p>

<p>
None of the watchers could tell who they were,
for the heavy foliage hid their faces; but when
the cavalcade swept round towards the castle,
Herman gripped Roye's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know who they are?" he whispered eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, I know," Roye muttered.  "One is
Captain Berndorff of the City Guard, and the man
riding at his side is Cochlaeus!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
WITHIN THE CASTLE
</h3>

<p>
The cavalcade halted at the drawbridge, and
a horseman sounded a trumpet which
brought a soldier to one of the towers
over the gate.
</p>

<p>
The watchers had gone forward among the trees,
keeping pace with the horses, and now saw and
heard all that passed.  The soldier demanded their
business, and the response came from Cochlaeus.
</p>

<p>
"Tell my lord of Schouts that the Deacon of
the Church of the Blessed Virgin wishes to confer
with him on a matter of the first importance.  Say
that I have ridden out from the city for that
purpose."
</p>

<p>
"Bad hours for a Churchman to keep," the
soldier remarked insolently, and laughing.  He
waited, to know whether Cochlaeus had more to
say, but, when he found that no answer came, he
turned away.  More than a quarter of an hour
passed, and then the gate opened slowly, the
portcullis was raised, and the drawbridge dropped over
the moat noisily.
</p>

<p>
"My lord says that the Deacon of the Church of
the Blessed Virgin may enter," said the warden surlily.
</p>

<p>
Berndorff, hearing what the soldier said, gave an
order, and the horsemen moved forward.  Already
the feet of the first two horses were on the bridge,
but the soldier caught at the bridles.
</p>

<p>
"Nay!" he cried.  "I told you that my lord
said that the Deacon might enter.  I ought to have
said, 'and no other'!  All else must stay outside
and cool their toes, or ride away, just as they please.
But as for going in, no!" the soldier exclaimed
roughly.
</p>

<p>
"An insolent varlet!" cried Cochlaeus, riding
forward.  "Is that how you speak to a dignitary
of the Church?" he asked angrily.
</p>

<p>
"I speak as my master bids me, and, whether
it be insolent or not, I stand by my orders," was the
sharp retort.  "These must wait until your business
is done and you come forth again."
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus was irresolute.  In his own mind
there was the fear that he might be detained by the
bandit lord, and held for heavy ransom, since it was
known that the treasure coffer of the Church of the
Blessed Virgin was a full one.  Schouts was known
among the Churchmen to care nothing for the
maledictions of the Church; and while he may have
thought seriously of armed men standing at his
gate in considerable numbers, he had no fear from
such as were in the community to which Cochlaeus
belonged.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis an insult," he cried angrily.
</p>

<p>
"That's for my lord to say, not for me," the
soldier answered, with indifference.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis inhospitable as well," the Inquisitor
exclaimed, "not to allow my attendants shelter at
such an hour, but they must stay outside!"
</p>

<p>
"Where lies the lack of hospitality?" came the
curt rejoinder.  "You come hither at your own
suggestion, and not as my master's guest.  Would
you suppose that he would suffer any to enter his
stronghold who chose to pass this way?  He can
surely say whom he will see, and refuse if he cares?"
</p>

<p>
The soldiers behind Cochlaeus sat grimly in their
saddles, but they understood.  Schouts was not
likely to admit any armed men who might prove
awkward if once they got across the bridge and held
the gate, keeping it wide open for hundreds to come
who might be lurking in the forest for surprise.
And as for Cochlaeus, were it not for their own
honour as soldiers in the service of the Burgomaster
of the city, they would have been well content to
see this heretic hunter lying stark and still on this
same bridge to which he had come to parley with
the robber lord.
</p>

<p>
"What must I do?" Cochlaeus cried angrily,
irritated by this undisguised insolence.  It was an
intrusion on his dignity which he would not have
brooked elsewhere.  But here was a lawless lord's
stronghold, and the master of it was known up and
down the river as one who was a law unto himself,
and dictated terms, especially within his own
domain.
</p>

<p>
"What must you do?" the warden responded
in surprise at the question.  "Come in alone, or
go away again, just as you may please.  I have my
lord's orders, and I won't go from them.  Nor dare
I.  None of these soldiers, therefore, may enter.
My lord will have none of them inside of his castle.
He said so when I took your message to him."
</p>

<p>
The soldiers on the drawbridge moved their horses
back, and stood with the others, while Cochlaeus,
going forward in an ill-humour, rode in at the dark
gateway.  Then his temper gave place to fear, for
it dawned upon him that he was placing himself
in the power of a man who might retort on the
Church to which he was an inveterate enemy, and
hold this heretic hunter for ransom.  His face paled,
and his hand trembled on the rein when the drawbridge
began to rise and the portcullis rushed down,
the sound of the loud rattle of chains coming as a
reminder of the helplessness of his position, and how
completely he was in the power of the bandit lord.
</p>

<p>
"Caught like a rat in a trap, I'll be bound,"
muttered Otto Engel, who, like his companions, was
watching all that passed, and trying to gauge how
far this night visit of Cochlaeus was likely to affect
the prisoner in the castle.  "Ay, like a rat in a
trap!  God grant he may never come out alive!"
he said, when the gates clanged together.  "But
come, friends.  Let us be on the move, lest that
Inquisitor has come to buy William Tyndale, and
will pay Schouts' price.  Then there is no saving
the poor man."
</p>

<p>
The ranger moved away at a run, winding in
and out among the bushes, leaping over little
runlets and brushing through thick undergrowth;
but his comrades kept pace with him, so that when
he halted under a gnarled oak, whose great branches
hung so heavily that he had to stoop to pass beneath
them, the others were but a little way behind.
</p>

<p>
"Is this the place?" Herman asked, bending
low to look for Engel, who was completely hidden.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  We'll waste no time now we are here,"
said the ranger.  "Stand there awhile and get
your breath," he said to Roye, who was panting
with his run.  "I will go first, and what I do you
must copy."
</p>

<p>
Getting a foothold on the trunk of the tree, he
climbed among the foliage and disappeared.
Herman could hear him mounting, the rustle of the
branches telling how he was moving.
</p>

<p>
"Art coming?" Engel asked presently, in a tone
which warned the others to be cautious.
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming," Herman whispered back, but he
turned to Roye.  "You had better go next, then I
shall know that you are safe.  I am used to climbing
trees, but possibly you are not."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis true," said the elder man, but he followed
Engel, and before long word came in the darkness
that he was safe.
</p>

<p>
When Herman stood with the others in the great
fork, which formed a natural platform, the ranger
dropped on his knees, and felt about in the darkness
with his hand.
</p>

<p>
When he had found what he wanted, he began to
descend into the body of the tree, the trunk proving
to be hollow.  The others could hear the sound of
his feet, as though he stepped on iron.  The fancy
became reality when Engel produced a light, and
while he held a lantern in his hand, they saw him
below, waiting for them to follow.
</p>

<p>
"Put your feet on those irons, and hold tight
with your hands, or you may get a nasty fall," he
whispered, pointing to some iron loops which had
been driven into the inside of the tree, forming
what was equivalent to a ladder.  Herman descended,
feeling with his feet for footing as he went, Roye
following closely.
</p>

<p>
Looking around them curiously when they stood
in a group, they saw all manner of insects crawling
about, startled by the light and this unwonted
invasion of their domain.  Many of them left
shiny tracks behind them, while some insects,
attracted by the lantern, flew against its horny
sides.
</p>

<p>
It was an unpleasant sight, but they had other
business on hand, and they went about it with that
quick glance at their surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Handing the lantern to Herman, the ranger
bent down and prodded the floor with his hunting-knife.
At every prod there was an answering metallic
sound.
</p>

<p>
"That's iron," said Herman, who was watching
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Don't you remember what the plan
showed you?" Engel replied.  "Ha!  This seems
to be what I want."
</p>

<p>
He had driven his knife into a crevice, and, scraping
the earth away, as he moved along, with the point,
he marked out a square space.  Driving in the point
of the tempered steel, he raised an iron plate which
worked on hinges, and, getting his hands to it when
it had come a little way, he threw it back against
the tree's side, and looked into a hole, the bottom of
which was lost in blackness.
</p>

<p>
Here, again, were iron clamps by which Engel
descended carefully, for some distance, until his
foot touched solid ground.  Herman followed and
found himself in a cavernous space.
</p>

<p>
Gazing around, they found that it was what they
expected according to the plan.  Here was a great
chamber, low-roofed, and narrowing down on one
side to a passage whose walls gleamed in the light
of the lantern.
</p>

<p>
The walls were veined in all directions, and the
yellow colour suggested gold; but this was no time
for close examination.  The matter in hand was the
finding of William Tyndale, to wrest him from
Schouts' harsh keeping before he had time to sell
him into the hands of those for whom Cochlaeus
was acting.
</p>

<p>
"Yonder is the passage," said the ranger, walking
the next moment across the floor with the others so
close at his heels that, when he halted unexpectedly,
they bundled against him.
</p>

<p>
For some distance the passage ran level, narrowing
down occasionally, so that Engel had to turn his
burly form sideways and squeeze himself through;
but after a time the floor sloped downwards, and
so steeply at some points that the footing was
treacherous.  It was made more so by the moisture
which oozed through the rocky ceiling and trickled
down the walls to the ground on which they trod.
</p>

<p>
"We are under the moat," whispered the ranger,
who stumbled while he carelessly turned to speak,
and barely saved himself from a heavy fall.
</p>

<p>
Having passed this slimy, moss-covered floor, they
found themselves on an ascending path, and there
they paused; for at this point the real danger of
their daring venture began.
</p>

<p>
"We are inside the castle," whispered Engel.
"What say you?  Shall we all go forward, or will
you both stay here while I go forward to see how the
land lies?"
</p>

<p>
"Let us go on farther," Herman proposed.  "We
ought not to be so far separated if one of us should
choose to stand back.  As far as I remember the
plan we have fifty yards or more to go before we
reach the corridor.  There is, moreover, a door at
the end of the passage, if the plan is true."
</p>

<p>
"It's true enough, so far," said Engel, "and why
not be correct all the way through?  I've heard my
father say so, and he knew, for he had tried it more
than once."
</p>

<p>
The ranger was moving forward while he spoke,
throwing light on the treacherous path with the
lantern.
</p>

<p>
For more than fifty yards they went their way,
touching the slimy walls at times, and treading on
softness they would have shuddered at, but for
this matter on their minds, and of such supreme
importance.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly they came to a full stop, for a wall was
in front of them, to all appearance solid rock, and
impassable.  But instead of dismay there was a
stifled sound of satisfaction.  It was what the plan
had marked.
</p>

<p>
Herman began to look about this rocky face,
smoothing his hand over it lightly, but for a time
he failed to find what he was searching for.  Then
he exclaimed in a tone of satisfaction, just as the
fear was coming that they had been misled:
</p>

<p>
"I have it!"
</p>

<p>
He felt a tiny knob of rock, and, pressing on it, the
wall began to move away slowly and heavily, but
without a sound.  The moment he took his hand
away, the rocky door stood still, leaving a crevice
sufficiently wide for them to peep through.
</p>

<p>
Hiding the lantern's light so that it should not
betray them, they saw a long passage, three or four
feet wide, but almost in darkness.  The only light it
contained was that of a smoking lamp hanging on the
wall far down the corridor.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we venture?" asked the ranger.
</p>

<p>
"What use was it to come so far, and not go
farther?" Roye asked almost testily.  "We have
to get my master out of this."
</p>

<p>
While he spoke he put out his hand and pressed
the door farther open.  Then, brushing past the
others, he stood in the passage.  Engel and Herman
followed.  Thrusting the door back into its place,
careful not to send it too far, for the latch to catch,
they looked at it in such dim light as there was, and
saw that it fitted into the roughly built wall so well
that none would suspect the presence of a door when
thrust back completely.  It was clear to them that
it was a secret entrance and exit, the existence of
which had probably been forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"Now for the next thing," said the ranger,
glancing up and down the passage anxiously.  "Put
your minds on that plan in my home, and you will
remember we had to take the first turning to the left.
It comes half-way between us here and that light
yonder."
</p>

<p>
He led the way, going softly and cautiously, ready
for advance or retreat, as things might chance.
Ere many yards had been traversed they came to
an opening on the left, and it led up some winding
steps, past doorways from none of which came any
sound or sign of life or light on the other sides.
The stairway opened on a long corridor, broad and
pretentious.  Some of the doorways had heavy
curtains hanging over them, and one into which
they peered, since the door was wide open, showed
the great banqueting-hall, with tapestries on the
walls, casques and bucklers, antlers, and many other
relics of the chase in the forest.  Across the hall
at the upper end ranged the high table at which the
lord of the castle sat, and the other tables ran down
by the walls, leaving the central space clear.
</p>

<p>
To linger was dangerous, and yet the nearer way
to Tyndale's cell lay through the hall.
</p>

<p>
"I'll not venture," Engel muttered, listening
intently for any sound of approaching voices or
footsteps, and realising, like the others, that in
this escapade they were almost challenging death.
"We'll go round, for who can tell what men may
come into the place when we are half-way across the
floor of that hall?  We should never get to yonder
door, nor any other door, except a dungeon one."
</p>

<p>
He turned away, hugging the wall as he went, and
always keeping an eye on the hanging curtains at the
doors.  His idea was that, if someone came into the
passage, he and his comrades in this deadly venture
might get into hiding until the danger had passed.
</p>

<p>
Every sound thrilled them, for the peril was so
great.  And yet they moved onwards, bent on
getting Tyndale away, if it were possible.  After
a time they came to a corner, and glanced along
another corridor shut off with heavy hangings.
</p>

<p>
Should they venture?  There was no hiding-place
nearer than a doorway a dozen yards farther
on.  And here Engel knew his way thoroughly,
for, being hail-fellow-well-met with many of the
retainers, he had often been there, and was always
welcome.  He knew that if he could pass that door
in safety he had but one more to go beyond, and he
would be at the steps which descended to the place
where, so Sprenkel had told him when they met
in the forest in the afternoon, the prisoner had been
placed.
</p>

<p>
The danger centred at that door, and Engel half
wished he had come alone, so that his movements
should not be hampered.  One could move where
three would find it impossible and dangerous.
</p>

<p>
"Roye," he whispered, while they were hidden
in the curtain, "one can move freely, and perhaps
two; but three are too many.  It adds so greatly
to the fear of discovery.  What say you to going
back to the secret door and staying in the passage,
keeping everything in readiness when we bring
William Tyndale with us?"
</p>

<p>
"Is there likely to be any fighting? for, if so, I
can do my share," said Roye readily.
</p>

<p>
"There will be no fighting.  It's a matter of
stealth, and three are too many.  One may blunder
and spoil everything.  We shall all be waiting for
each other."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go back, but not willingly," came the
reluctant response.  "I wanted greatly to be one
of those to go to my master, but I see the difficulty."
</p>

<p>
Roye turned on his heel.
</p>

<p>
"Can you find the way?" Engel whispered; and
Roye, answering quickly, went back softly.  They
watched him until he disappeared at the steps.
</p>

<p>
"He's brave enough," the ranger said sincerely,
"and I like the man's spirit.  There's no doubt as
to the love he has for his master, and he's sore at
heart at turning back.  But three are too many."
</p>

<p>
Engel and Herman made a hurried progress
down the dimly-lit corridor, making for one of the
doors, but they hid themselves among some curtains
almost in panic, for a page-boy came into view at
one of the corners, whistling gaily as he walked
along carelessly.  He passed on, unsuspecting, not
even looking at the heavy curtains.
</p>

<p>
As for those in hiding, they almost forgot the boy
in the intensity of their surprise at what they saw.
From among the folds in which they stood, they
looked into a gorgeous chamber, and at the table, in
the centre, so seated that the flaming logs upon
the hearth lit up their faces, making the lights of
the candles dim with the red glow, were two men.
</p>

<p>
One was Schouts, the robber lord.  The other was
Cochlaeus.  Both had wine goblets by their hand,
and were talking seriously.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
THE MAN IN THE DUNGEON
</h3>

<p>
"What will you give me, Deacon, if I
hand you over this prisoner of mine,
whose name, you say, is William
Tyndale?"
</p>

<p>
Schouts lifted the silver flagon while he spoke,
and filled his goblet.
</p>

<p>
"Two hundred and fifty golden crowns, my lord&mdash;the
price that is set on that fellow's head," Cochlaeus
answered.
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried Schouts, in sharp surprise, with
the goblet half-way to his lips.  "You would make
a crafty bargain with me, and pay me as much as
you would pay one of my retainers if they chanced
to find this lean-faced Englishman?"
</p>

<p>
Schouts laughed scornfully, and instead of drinking
he brought down the goblet heavily to the
table, spilling the wine on his hand.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a big sum, my lord.  Two hundred and
fifty golden crowns."
</p>

<p>
"It may be, Deacon, but I should get as much
from this fellow's friends in Hamburg, for since I
got hold of him I am told that some English
merchants there have some regard for him, and are
finding him money for this enterprise of his, this
writing of pestilent papers.  I shall go to them,
perhaps to-morrow&mdash;perhaps to-night&mdash;and tell them
how anxious the Churchmen are to burn their
friend, but they only value him for fuel to an
Inquisition fire at two hundred and fifty crowns.
They will give me five hundred without a word,
I'll warrant you, and think they got this Tyndale
cheaply.  But I'll not take five hundred from them,
nor from you.  The price for that Englishman in
my dungeon is a thousand crowns, down here on
this table, if you are the purchaser.  Then you
may torture him to your heart's content, or burn
him, just as you are disposed."
</p>

<p>
"A thousand crowns!" cried Cochlaeus, gazing
at the robber lord in blank amazement, and in his
movement of surprise unwittingly overturning the
wine goblet near his hand.  "Who would give you
such a preposterous sum?  No one!"
</p>

<p>
He brought his clenched fist heavily on the table
while he spoke.
</p>

<p>
Schouts laughed, then drank off his wine,
draining his goblet and filling it again before he
answered.
</p>

<p>
"I said a thousand crowns, and golden ones.
And if nobody will give me that much, no one has
him but myself, and I shall keep him.  He won't
cost much for his food, and I shall get a bit of
satisfaction out of it all.  I shall know, for instance,
that you and your torturing crew in those Holy
House cellars where you keep your racks and your
thumbscrews are consumed with anger because you
cannot work your will on that man you want so
badly, and won't buy at my price."
</p>

<p>
Schouts sipped at his wine two or three times,
staring at Cochlaeus, half amused at the look on the
Churchman's face.
</p>

<p>
"I shall keep him for a time, and he may bring
me in a good sum before I have done with him.
His friends may go beyond the thousand when they
know where he is."
</p>

<p>
"I can't believe it!" exclaimed Cochlaeus, in a
tone of incredulity.
</p>

<p>
"Can you not?" cried Schouts.  "Look you,
Deacon Cochlaeus!  If this man goes out of my
hands, whether to his friends or to his foes, he will
not go until I see a thousand crowns of gold on
this table.  Now you have my answer.  I won't
take nine hundred and ninety-nine.  It shall be
a thousand; and when you have brought me that
many you may do as you please with him, for
then he is yours, body and soul."
</p>

<p>
The robber had stood up, and, pushing back his
chair, so that it fell to the floor with a noisy clatter, he
went to the hearth, and, having kicked the logs
together with his boot, stood with his back to
the fire and looked to see how this emissary of the
Inquisition received his ultimatum.
</p>

<p>
"Say seven hundred and fifty, my lord,"
exclaimed Cochlaeus, now standing.  "A thousand
crowns is such an enormous sum for a penniless
man."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis William Tyndale's price, whether he is
penniless or rolls in wealth," came the dogged
answer.  "And, as I said, I won't take a golden
crown less, not even nine hundred and ninety-nine."
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus paced the floor to and fro, his feet
treading on some magnificent carpets which must
have come from Turkish looms.  He had no thought
for all the luxury that was round him&mdash;the spoils of
many a piracy.  His thoughts were on the man for
whose purchase he was bargaining, whom he longed
to see crouching in one of the dungeons of the
Inquisition, presently to be bound on the wheel
and broken, or put to some other torture, and, if he
had his own way, burnt in the open market-place
of the city which he had dared to pollute with his
shameless sheets!
</p>

<p>
But the price!  This robber lord had the audacity
to ask a thousand golden crowns, and as he
had already protested, the sum was preposterous.
Yet, before he came away to hunt down the
arch-heretic, who was dealing such deadly blows at
Mother Church, and spreading far and wide his
pestiferous books, his fellow-Inquisitors had told
him that a thousand, or even two thousand, golden
crowns would not be too much if it would bring
Tyndale into their power.  They would be able
to silence him for ever, and he would not then
seduce the people to heresy.
</p>

<p>
Schouts stood with his back to the blazing logs,
and watched the Churchman with a sinister look
on his face, as he moved backwards and forwards,
debating this question of payment to the bandit
lord.  As for the lord of the castle, he was smiling
to himself, although his face was stern, to think that
he was wringing out a thousand golden crowns from
a Church for which, in his godless way, he had the
most profound contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Deacon, what decision?" he asked
abruptly, when Cochlaeus seemed no nearer to
it.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot decide," the Churchman protested.
"The terms are so exorbitant.  Who ever heard
of such a sum&mdash;a thousand crowns&mdash;for one of
Tyndale's stamp?"
</p>

<p>
Schouts laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I've more to add, and that, too, may prove
preposterous!" he exclaimed.  "I forgot, when I
fixed the price for my prisoner, that I must have a
full pardon for every sin of which I stand convicted&mdash;my
robberies, what you and many another call my
murders, my wanton insults&mdash;to quote you again&mdash;to
some of the Church's high dignitaries&mdash;for
everything that you and yours may count a sin!  That
and the thousand crowns!  So now decide, and
quickly, for I want to be gone."
</p>

<p>
He was going to say more, but there were quick
steps on the stones of the corridor, and then a man
came in without ceremony, and, breathless with
haste, strode to where Schouts was standing.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-160"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-160.jpg" alt="&quot;MY LORD, THERE IS A SHIP COMING ROUND THE BEND,&quot; THE MAN CRIED, BREATHLESSLY.">
<br>
&quot;MY LORD, THERE IS A SHIP COMING ROUND THE BEND,&quot; THE<br>
MAN CRIED, BREATHLESSLY.
</p>

<p>
"My lord," he cried, not heeding the Churchman,
who had paused in his restless walk to hear what
Schouts had to say, "there is a ship coming
round the bend.  She is the same you bade me
keep a sharp look out for."
</p>

<p>
The man held his hands to his sides, and sought
to regain his squandered breath, but Schouts,
filling his goblet with wine, gave it to the soldier,
told him to drink, and follow him quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I will talk with you later, Deacon Cochlaeus,"
Schouts exclaimed, facing his visitor; "but I must
see to this business at once.  But bethink you of
what I said.  A thousand crowns and absolution,
or nothing."  He halted at the door, and the
confusion on the face of the Churchman so amused him
that he burst into loud laughter.  "By the way,
twelve hours hence my price will be raised.  Maybe
I'll ask for fifteen hundred crowns."
</p>

<p>
He pulled the door after him, and walked swiftly
along the corridor, looking to his weapons as he went.
</p>

<p>
The great bell of the castle clanged a few moments
later.  The sound of it travelled to the building's
farthest depths, and away beyond the walls, into
the forest itself, for, as Otto Engel whispered, he
had often heard it in his hut, and knew that there
was murder afoot.
</p>

<p>
Those who hid behind the curtain heard the tramp
of men, and before long they came by in haste.
They were taking the shortest cuts to be in time to
form up and receive the commands from their lord,
who was bawling out his orders in the courtyard,
Some, to save time, rushed through the room in
which Cochlaeus stood&mdash;in at one door and out at
that where Herman and the forester were hiding.
They were buckling on their swords as they went,
and, careless of the Churchman's dignity, brushed
past him, almost overturning him in their haste.
Cochlaeus' jaw dropped when the last to pass
through the chamber was a priest, who did not look
his way, but hurried on with noisy cries and oaths
and drunken laughter.
</p>

<p>
Before long the clatter of men's feet was heard
outside, and a horse's hoofs beat on the stones,
then thundered on the drawbridge when it was
lowered.  Herman and his companion knew what
it meant, for the robber lord and his retainers were
on the way to another daring act of piracy.
</p>

<p>
"God be praised!" exclaimed Engel, in a low tone.
"'Tis our opportunity.  That prayer in my hut is
going to be answered," he whispered, but even then
the voice thrilled with exultation.
</p>

<p>
Gripping Herman by the arm, he drew him from
the curtains, and hurried with him down the passage
they had traversed before, to the open door of the
banqueting-hall.  There they paused to look in
cautiously, to discover whether it was empty.  No
one was there, and, taking the risks, they went
through it at a run and out by the door at the
other end.
</p>

<p>
When they passed the kitchens they, too, were
empty.  Not a sound was heard, save what was
distant, for the bell was no longer clanging, and
every man within the castle, throwing aside his task,
whatever its nature, was gone, either to take his
stand on guard at the drawbridge or above the gate,
or to descend the slope to the river, to deal with
the doomed vessel that had been daring enough
to venture past in the dark night hours.  She was
going to pay the price of her mad audacity, and the
robber lord was there to extort it to the last penny.
</p>

<p>
Going along the deserted corridor, Herman and
the ranger came to some steps, down which they
went swiftly after Engel had snatched at one of the
few lamps that were hanging on the wall.  The
steps were black as night, but with the lamp's aid
now they went down and down, until they came to
a sudden stop at a blank wall.  But here they saw
that on the left were other steps, breaking off at
right angles, and descending they came to a door
studded with nails and sheeted with iron, crossed
with bolts and bars.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis here," whispered Engel.  "And here's the
key, just as Sprenkel said."
</p>

<p>
A great key hung on a nail near by the door, and
the ranger, taking it down, thrust it into the lock.
When he twisted it, the bolt went back with a scream
which seemed dangerously loud in the quietness of
the castle depths.  Herman, meanwhile, was busy,
for they both knew well how precious the moments
were, and what they were to do they must do
quickly.  He pulled back the bolts and dropped
the bars, and, thus free to move, the door was
thrust open into darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Are you there, Master Tyndale?" Herman
whispered, stepping down into the dungeon.
</p>

<p>
"I am here.  Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
The question came in tremulous tones, which gave
the two strong men at the door the impression that
the voice was that of a weakened man.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Herman and a friend.  Come at once.  We
want to get you away from this robber's castle, and
the moments are precious."
</p>

<p>
Engel stood with the lamp lifted high, to see where
the prisoner lay in this dank dungeon.  The uneven
floor was full of pools, and the walls ran with
moisture, while, in the momentary silence, before any
more was said, a drop of water fell with a musical
note into one of the pools, and made the broken
surface shimmer in the lamplight.  Herman's eyes
were quick to see the misery of the place.  There
were crawling creatures on the floor and the walls,
and dull green moss coated the floor.
</p>

<p>
That, at first, was all he saw; but presently he
saw William Tyndale kneeling on a spread of damp
straw in a corner behind the door.
</p>

<p>
He was looking their way, uncertain as to those
who had come to this fetid cell; half wondering
whether it was reality, or that he was dreaming that
he had really heard Herman's voice.  Herman caught
the gleam in his eyes from the lamp's light, and went
forward.  And still it seemed to the prisoner such an
incredible thing, till Herman was really near him,
scuffling his feet among the straw, and flinging a
strong arm about his shoulder, kissing the cold
cheek, and telling him that he and his comrade had
been searching for him, meaning to get him away.
</p>

<p>
Tyndale put out his manacled hands to grasp
those of the young man who had been tender and
loving as a son for the past months.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis wonderful!" the prisoner exclaimed, trying
to rise from his kneeling posture.  "You might
almost have heard the words of my prayer when you
came to the door.  'Out of the depths have I cried
unto Thee, o Lord.  Bring my soul out of prison,
that I may praise Thy name.'  And think of it!
The Lord heard my supplication, and made haste
to help me!"
</p>

<p>
Herman bent down, and, throwing his strong
arms about the kneeling prisoner, lifted him to
his feet; but Tyndale could not stand without the
young man's aid.
</p>

<p>
"I am very weak," Tyndale said, in a trembling
tone.  "Since I left your home I have not touched
a morsel of food, and none has been brought to me."
</p>

<p>
For the first time they heard the clank of chains,
and when Engel lowered the lamp he saw that
Tyndale's feet were in irons.
</p>

<p>
"The cowardly hounds!" he exclaimed, his anger
blazing forth when he saw what had been done.
"God do so to me, and more also&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Tyndale checked him.
</p>

<p>
"Say it not, friend.  God can best requite what
has been done to me.  But can we not go away,
since, as you said, the moments are very precious?
I should feel the stroke of my misfortune in double
measure if you met with trouble in your desire to
help me."
</p>

<p>
The forester looked carefully at Tyndale, at his
hands and feet, and then, to his confusion, saw
that there was a chain about his body which fastened
the prisoner to the wall, so that at the farthest he
could not get more than a yard or two across the
floor.
</p>

<p>
"Herman, hold this lamp!" he cried.  Then,
passing closer to the wall, his lips shut tightly in
his frenzy of determination, he gripped the chain
with his strong hands and strove to wrench away
the iron ring at the wall.
</p>

<p>
It was a task beyond his power, and Herman,
understanding his purpose, set the lamp down on
the floor and went to his side, to grip the chain as
well.  Then, with their strength combined, they
tugged and tugged at what seemed a hopeless
task.  They pulled and strained, planting their
feet against the wall, until the veins in their
fore-heads seemed to stand out like whipcord.
</p>

<p>
"It's coming!" said Engel exultantly.  "See!
The iron is moving in the wall.  Again! with all
your might, Herman!  We won't be done!"
</p>

<p>
The pull was the supreme effort of their strength,
and the iron ring broke open, and the chain was set
free, so suddenly that the two men fell backwards
heavily on the floor among the pools.
</p>

<p>
Scrambling to their feet, scarcely waiting to rub
their bruises, they went forward to where Tyndale
sat in his weakness.
</p>

<p>
"Take up the lamp, Herman," said the forester,
"and show the way.  Tell me where the risky
places are, so that I take no false step at
all."
</p>

<p>
Herman asked no questions, and Engel, bending
low, took Tyndale up in his strong arms as a woman
might take a child.  Making light of his burden, he
followed at the younger man's heels, and, although
the steps were treacherous with slime, he almost
pressed Herman forward.  For the younger man was
going cautiously, not knowing what danger might
suddenly confront them.
</p>

<p>
The castle seemed to be silent, and no sound was
heard save that of their own hurried footsteps in
the passage and the faint and occasional clinking
of Tyndale's fetters.
</p>

<p>
"Make for the secret passage," Engel whispered,
panting a little with his burden after having climbed
the treacherous steps so quickly.  "Go ahead, and
see whether the way is clear.  Put the lantern down,
anywhere, for if anyone saw a moving light it
would awaken suspicion, and we don't want to run
the risk of being challenged.  If you hear any sound,
stand by and see if it means danger."
</p>

<p>
Herman blew out the light, and, setting the
lantern on the floor in a dark place, he went forward
at a run, on his toes, alert and urgent; but no one
crossed his path.  When he peeped into the
banqueting-hall it was empty.  For any sound or
sight in that dangerous venture the great castle
might have been deserted by everything living
except himself and his companions.  It was so
wherever he went, and at last he came to the door
in the wall.
</p>

<p>
Roye had drawn it after him, just as closely as
he found it, to prevent suspicion in the mind of a
possible passer-by and Herman stood by, without
opening it, waiting for Otto Engel to come up with
his burden.  He turned the corner sooner than
Herman expected, but in the dim light it was easy to
see that the load he carried was growing heavy,
as much almost with nervous strain as with the
actual weight; for this daring enterprise was so
beset with danger that the forester had lived what
seemed to be hours of anxious thought in those
brief minutes which passed between the dungeon and
the secret door.
</p>

<p>
He knew that if they were seen by any of the castle
soldiers or servitors, and caught red-handed, as it
were, and with a helpless man in chains, he and
Herman would have a desperate fight to wage
against overwhelming odds.  What, he asked
himself, as he carried William Tyndale, worn down
with weakness and privation, and feeling him
growing heavier with every yard he covered&mdash;what if
one of the page-boys or some of the women should
be moving about and, seeing them, run away, screaming
out an alarm!  Only God could tell the consequences,
and it might well end in death for each of
the three.
</p>

<p>
The forester was within three or four yards of
the place where Herman was awaiting him, when
he caught the gleam of steel in the younger man's
hand, and saw by the light of one of the lamps on
the wall that he was bending forward and gazing
along the passage.  He went even more softly than
before, and with his intensely quickened hearing he
heard the sound of someone singing&mdash;a boyish
voice shouting out the robber's song.
</p>

<p>
Although he had been feeling overborne with his
burden, and the sweatdrops were on his brow, the
forester hurried forward.  He might have had no
burden in his arms at all, so swiftly did he bound
over those last few yards.
</p>

<p>
"Open the door!" he exclaimed, reckless now;
for if he could pass through the doorway with his
burden and the door could be pulled into its place
again, he thought their safety was assured.
</p>

<p>
It was not necessary to say so much, for Herman
dug his finger nails into what little edge there was,
and pulled the door open, so that he looked into the
dark, forbidding gap.  Dark though it was, the
forester did not hesitate, but hurried in.
</p>

<p>
Waiting for the moment when he could follow,
Herman kept his gaze fixed on the distant end where
there was a possible corner which the boy would
turn at any moment.  The passage was still empty,
although the sound of stamping feet grew plainer,
rattling to the rhythm of the song.  The relief was
intense, to know that William Tyndale was carried
into the secret way without being seen.  It was
now his own turn to enter, and it must be at once.
</p>

<p>
He stepped into the blackness, careful as to where
he placed his feet, and began to draw the door
after him.  At that moment Roye came near to him
with his lantern, and in the swift glance he took
along the passage, Herman saw that a sharp line of
light from the lantern fell across the floor of the
passage, and on the opposite wall.  At that same
moment the boy turned the corner and came into
view.  He must have seen the line of light, for he
halted suddenly, and the song gave place to an
exclamation of wonder and half of alarm.  In his
own keen thought Herman pictured the boy gazing
along the passage with startled eyes; but he did not
wait to see what happened.  The opening in the
wall closed up with a soft thud, and as he looked,
Herman saw that the latch had caught, and the
entrance was securely blocked.
</p>

<p>
How much had the boy seen? Herman asked
himself, wiping the dampness from his forehead,
for this narrow escape had startled him.  Surely,
only the flash of the line of light, for he had entered
so speedily, urged on by the dread of discovery.
</p>

<p>
"Where are the others, Roye?" he asked, only
seeing him, as he turned his back on the door.
</p>

<p>
"We're all right," said Engel, and Herman saw
him close by in the passage, and, having set his
burden gently on the floor, he was wiping his face
and neck with his cap.  "Did anyone see you?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  The boy swung round the corner into the
passage, a long way off, but he could not have seen
more than the flash of this lantern across the floor
just as I had stepped in and was pulling the door
into its place."
</p>

<p>
Herman said it bravely, but this experience had
tried him greatly, and now he stood with his back
against the wall, in something like helplessness,
and his knees were trembling, while he felt his lips
quivering.
</p>

<p>
They turned their attention to Tyndale, and going
on their knees beside him they sought to discover
how much he was in need of help, and what likelihood
there was of getting him away.  The man for whom
they had dared so greatly sat on the rocky floor,
fettered heavily, his back set against the wall of
rock, and his head bowed so that his chin rested on
his bosom.  But his thin hand was lifted to take
theirs, while he thanked them for their splendid
service.
</p>

<p>
Herman held him by the hand, while all three
watched him anxiously.  In that uncertain light he
looked to them like a dying man, and he seemed
to guess their thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"I am very weak and ill, Herman," he said
quietly; "but you came in time.  I shall not die,
but live, for God has brought me out of the depths
to give me the opportunity to complete His work."
</p>

<p>
Weak though he was, on life's borderland, as it
seemed to his companions, there was a thrill of
exultation in his voice.  He spoke as one would
speak who had unshaken confidence in the success
of his mission.
</p>

<p>
Still watching him, they felt that his condition was
serious.  They saw in him a man capable of high
and prolonged endurance, but the strain of the past
few months, when he was compelled to remain in the
house in hiding, foregoing exercise and recreation,
and especially during these last few days, when he was
seeking to get away from his would-be tormentors,
had borne him down, and he had come to the end
of his reserve strength.  Yet, to their amazement,
he was exultant and confident, and they realised
in those moments of watching that William Tyndale
was a man whose character had been matured in
the hardest of all schools, annealed in the furnace,
and not forgetful, although the chains were about
his hands and feet, of the Hand that was strong
beyond that of men, and had brought him out of
the dungeon depths.
</p>

<p>
"Is my wallet all right, Herman?" Tyndale asked
anxiously, too weak to look for himself; too weak,
indeed, to lift his hand to feel for the strap across
his breast.
</p>

<p>
Herman saw it hanging about his shoulders by the
leather band, and told him it was there.  He gently
guided his hand so that he might feel it; then
brought the wallet round for him to see, and have
it in his lap.  In spite of his chains, Tyndale hugged
it to his bosom.
</p>

<p>
"I should have been bereft indeed if I had lost
these treasures," he muttered.  They were his
stock-in-trade, as he had said at other times half
humorously.  His books were in the wallet&mdash;those precious
volumes from whence he drew the material for his
translated Bible.
</p>

<p>
But the watchers were anxious and perplexed,
not knowing what next to do, now that they found
Tyndale so near to collapse, and, in spite of his
exultation and confidence, so near, as they thought,
to death.  What if, after having ventured so far, they
had a dead man on their hands?  Or if not that,
how were they to get him away?  And where should
they lodge him until he grew stronger?

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
IN THE CELL
</h3>

<p>
When Margaret came to herself, after she
had fallen in a senseless heap on the
cavern floor, she found herself in
darkness, and lying on some straw.
</p>

<p>
Sitting up, she began to link up slowly with the
past, so that she recalled her desperate venture into
the place which had so much in it to terrify her.
With this came the remembrance of the voices she
had heard.  She recalled it all, and the dread
returned, for surely she was lying in the same
place, and her surroundings were distressing as
before.
</p>

<p>
These were her thoughts; and, presently, she
determined to move away, to get into the outer air
again; anywhere, rather than endeavour to find
her way along those forbidding passages which led
to Herman's home.
</p>

<p>
She rose to her feet and moved cautiously, with
her hands stretched out before her, lest her face
should beat against something in the darkness.
She had not gone far before she touched a wall, and
it felt cold and damp.
</p>

<p>
Still going carefully, one hand moving along the
wall, or what she supposed to be the rocky side of the
cavern, she shivered at the thought of what her feet
might presently touch&mdash;those forbidding skeletons
over which, when she first came with Herman, she
had thrown her cloak in reverence for the unknown
dead.
</p>

<p>
But with the dread there was another thought,
and one of surprise.
</p>

<p>
This rock, or wall, which she was touching was wet,
and the air had a clammy feeling in it.  Her hand
became so damp that she caught up her skirt to
wipe it.  She shuddered when she felt her way on
again, thinking to get to the opening to the river,
for her hand touched a chill and slimy substance,
and then it moved.
</p>

<p>
What did it mean?  The rock which she and
Herman had gone round was dry; the floor was
crisp and dry as well.  Thinking of this, she bent
down to feel what the floor was like, and it was wet.
</p>

<p>
She was bewildered.  Was she in the same place,
or had she wandered somewhere else in a state
of semi-consciousness, in a sleep-walk, perhaps?
Determined to solve this problem, she moved on,
and then her hand touched something which brought
a cry of wonder to her lips.
</p>

<p>
There was a break in the wall, and her hand went
out into the open air, but as she moved her hand
farther it struck against something, and her fingers
closed over a cold iron bar.  There was another,
and a third.  Running her hands up and down the
bars, she came to a stop at the top; to another stop
at the bottom.  Looking before her, she saw something
glinting, and, watching it, she knew it to be a
star.  In her growing astonishment she saw another,
and yet one more; then many.  There was a moon
somewhere, but hidden behind the clouds which
again and again rolled by and shut away the stars.
</p>

<p>
It began to dawn on her that she was not in the
cavern.  She continued her progress along the wall,
and came to something, the discovery of which
brought a cry of anguish to her lips.  It was a door,
cold to the touch, and sheeted with iron, rough on
the surface, as though the rust had formed on it
because of the dampness of the place.  As her soft
hand ran over it she felt iron ribs crossing the door
from left to right, and solid studs like the square
heads of great nails.
</p>

<p>
A greater horror came to her than if she had found
herself shut up in the cavern near to Herman's home;
for now she knew that she was not in it.
</p>

<p>
This was some other place&mdash;but what?
</p>

<p>
Determined to assure herself, she stood with her
back to the door, and walked forward slowly, groping
in the darkness, with her hand stretched out before
her.  She had not gone far before her feet brushed
against something which rustled, and, stooping, her
hand touched some spread-out straw.  Once more
upright, she moved across the straw, and came to
the wall.
</p>

<p>
The truth dawned on her now, and she sank on
the straw with a sense of horror, hopelessness, an
indescribable fear&mdash;she knew not what to call it.
But this she knew, that she was in prison!
</p>

<p>
She buried her face in her hands and, shuddering,
tried to think this thing out.  Why should she be in a
prison cell, and not in a cavern with an outlet to the
open air, where, when she came to herself she might
have waited by the river till the day dawned, and
she could have gone to the city gates, and so to her
home?
</p>

<p>
She recalled the voices which had startled her in
the cavern.  To whom did they belong?  Were
they river robbers? and was it possible that they
made the cavern one of their hiding-places?  She
began to put the thing into shape.  These robbers
had found her, and had carried her to some inner
place, thinking to deal with her later on, when they
had time.
</p>

<p>
It was a terrible plight for a delicate girl to be in,
and she prayed for God's shielding if she had fallen
into the hands of desperate and disreputable men.
</p>

<p>
Another thought gripped her which seemed more
terrible than the other.  What if those voices belonged
to the emissaries of the Inquisition, who had gained
an inkling of the fact that William Tyndale was
hiding hereabouts, and had come to search the
cavern on the chance of finding him?  If that
were so, then they had found her while she was
unconscious, and had carried her to this cell.  It
was fearful to contemplate the possibility, that
this was one of the dungeons in the place which was
known throughout the city as the Holy House.
</p>

<p>
Margaret crouched on the heap of straw until the
light of the day-dawn began to creep through the
barred window.  When she lifted her white, drawn,
tear-stained face, and gazed around, she saw that it
was as she feared.  She really was in a prison;
and from what was there, it surely was a part of the
Inquisitors' House.  When her eyes ranged round
the damp walls, where the morning sun came in
brokenly, and made the lines of trickling moisture
gleam, she saw a great crucifix hanging opposite the
window, so placed that the prisoner could not fail
to be reminded of the religion and the Church to
which she was supposed to be a renegade.  The size
of this one in the cell was disconcerting, for it was as
large as life, as though the Inquisitors meant that
the figure of the suffering Saviour should be intrusive.
</p>

<p>
The long hours went, and Margaret was left to her
loneliness.  No one came with food, and nothing
had passed her lips for all the hours that had gone
since she left her home on her father's errand to bid
Tyndale leave the city.  She looked about to see
whether the usual prison fare was in the cell&mdash;the
bread and water; but none was there.
</p>

<p>
Nothing living came, save a bird that hopped
about on the window-sill, between the bars, and
peeped in at the prisoner.  Standing in the line of
light, the little creature sang his song, but Margaret
gained no cheering from it, sweet though it was.
There was liberty for that pretty bit of feathered
life, which only served to make her feel the misery of
her own imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
The bird flew away, and Margaret's loneliness
grew on her.  Hunger had begun its torment, and
thirst as well.  Was this to be her treatment?
Had they who brought her here discovered that she
was a friend of William Tyndale, and now they
meant to leave her to hunger and thirst and
loneliness until she died?
</p>

<p>
That thought brought her from her crouching
attitude on to her knees; and then, with her hands
clasped and her head bent low, she prayed.  She
asked for deliverance.  She knew not how it would
come, but God, she was sure, would find the way.
Then came the alternative to her prayer, but she
paused and wondered whether she could take it.
Could she ask for deliverance, but then say, "If it
be possible let this cup pass from me; nevertheless,
not as I will, but as Thou wilt"?  She sobbed, for
it was so hard to say, "Thy will be done."
</p>

<p>
For a time she paused at that point, undergoing
the struggle, shrinking from it.  She was half
rebellious at first; but presently the full surrender
came; and the words rang out, "Not as I will but
as Thou wilt."  If she was to go the way of the
martyrs, she pleaded that she might be true, and go
on to the end of her martyrdom.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the afternoon when she heard a
sound by the door.  A key was thrust into the lock
from outside, and it screamed as it turned.  Then
came the thrusting back of bolts, so many of them,
Margaret thought bitterly.  What could a girl do,
that she should be kept in durance by an iron door,
with lock and bolts and bars?
</p>

<p>
The door opened outwards, and, watching intently,
wondering who was coming, she saw two men,
cowled and gowned like the Familiars she had
sometimes seen in the streets.  Neither of them spoke,
but one who carried a jar of water in one hand and
a loaf in the other, set the water at her feet and
tossed the bread on the straw.  He turned away
in silence, going back to the door with muffled tread,
where, he waited, without a word.
</p>

<p>
Margaret sprang to her feet, and, going to him,
caught at his coarse, black robe, but he tore her
hand away, still without speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Why have you brought me here?" she cried,
and her face was full of eagerness.
</p>

<p>
The man made no reply, but stood looking at her,
unmoved, apparently, in spite of the traces of her
grief on her face.
</p>

<p>
"Have you no answer for me?  If you brought
me here, what was your right?  And what was my
crime, that you should bring me to this horrible
place?"
</p>

<p>
She spoke impulsively and boldly, like one who
was fighting for her life, and was taking the chance
now that it was here.
</p>

<p>
The man was silent and still, as though he
had been stone, and the girl gazed at him in
wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Do you not hear me?" she cried.
</p>

<p>
She clutched at his robe and shook his arm, as if
to compel him to do something that was human, and
not stand there in baleful silence as though he were
made of stone.  He caught her hand in his, and
with a rough wrench that made her cry out with
pain, he tore it away from his robe, and thrust her
from him with such force that she staggered and
fell heavily on the straw.
</p>

<p>
The other Familiar was meanwhile passing round
the cell, looking at everything intently, and especially
at the window-bars, as if to satisfy himself that they
had not been tampered with, and that there was no
possibility of the prisoner's escape.  He, too, was
silent, and, going to the door when his investigation
was ended, he passed away with the other.  The door
closed noisily, and those sounds which followed
made Margaret feel the more how impossible it was
to hope for escape.
</p>

<p>
For a time the bread and water remained untouched,
but hunger and thirst compelled her to eat.
The coarse black bread, the like of which she had
never eaten before, was so dry that she had to soak
it in the water.  The food satisfied her hunger and
took away her sense of weakness, but there was
the long night coming, with its loneliness and
uncertainty, perhaps its horrors.
</p>

<p>
The darkness began to enshroud the place, so
little was the opening through which the sunset light
could come.  Somewhere outside, Margaret could
hear the birds singing their evening songs, but these
grew less and less until the last note came, and the
silence of the night began.
</p>

<p>
Gradually what was in the cell grew indistinct.
The image of the Saviour on the cross faded away;
and although she had watched it disappear, bit by
bit, there was nothing of the crucifix at last for her
to see.  She turned to the window, but that, too,
with its bars, lost its shape, and the night came on
so blackly that she would not have known where to
look for it.  After some hours had gone the cell
began to look less dark.  The things that had been
hidden began to appear, dimly and indistinctly,
until the moon came away from the horizon and
later shone out clearly while she took her silent
night ride through the heavens.  This silver light,
stealing in, made the cell seem less lonely.
</p>

<p>
At last, after shaking up the straw, to lie more
easily, she threw herself down upon it, after prayer,
and fell into a dreamless sleep.  When she awoke it
was day, and the world was alive and beautiful in
the sunshine, although she had no token of what was
going on save from the songs of the birds.  In the
cell itself there was silence but for the scramble of a
rat at odd times across the floor.  Then she knew
what the creature's errand was, for it had eaten some
of her bread.  All else was quiet, and the stillness of
the house to which her cell belonged was such that
it appalled her.  She would have welcomed the
slam of a door, or the sound of a human voice,
however harsh, or the tramp of a man's feet.
</p>

<p>
The thought came to her that possibly a part of
her torture was this intolerable loneliness.  What
might it not mean to her if it continued many days
and nights?
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
SPOILING THE EGYPTIANS
</h3>

<p>
William Tyndale was so weak and ill
when Engel had carried him as far as the
cavern, and set him down there, that they
wondered whether they had brought him
from the dungeon only to see him die.  Kneeling at
his side, the forester watched him seriously, and then
it struck him that what Tyndale wanted was food.
</p>

<p>
"Stay here, Herman, and you, Roye, and keep
watch, while I go to my hut for food," he said, looking
up at the others, who were gazing down at the
over-wrought prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Herman was alert in an instant.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a long way, Otto, and the shortest time
before you could return would be more than an
hour and a half," he protested; but Engel responded
almost impatiently:
</p>

<p>
"I know that.  But if I stay here he will die;
and how to get him hence unless he can put a foot
forward for his own helping, which is not possible,
I do not know."
</p>

<p>
"Let me go back into the castle and look for some
food!" Herman exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The forester was aghast at the proposal.
</p>

<p>
"Then we shall have two dead men on our
hands, or at all events one helpless, like this poor
one," pointing to Tyndale, "and a dead one, which
will be yourself," he cried.
</p>

<p>
"I think not," said Herman sturdily, looking to
his belt to see that he had a weapon handy.  "I
will go cautiously, and I know my way about by this
time.  There was some food on the tables in the
banqueting-hall&mdash;a meal, doubtless for the retainers,
all ready, but the men had not come to it because of
that summons to the river."
</p>

<p>
The forester demurred.  The proposed errand
was too full of danger for his assent to be given with
readinesss.
</p>

<p>
"I mean to go," said Herman, in such a tone of
quiet determination that the other felt that it would
be useless to attempt to hinder him.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then.  I admire your boldness, but I
think it next door to madness!" exclaimed Engel.
"Take the lantern with you."
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't do that.  I can grope my way along
the passage, and when I am once on the other side
of that door I shall be safer without a light.  While
I am away, why not see whether it is possible to
break away those fetters from Master Tyndale's
limbs?  Stay here, Roye, and help Engel in doing
what can be done for the dear man's comfort."
</p>

<p>
"That's easily done," said the forester, smiling,
and he brought out a file which he had hidden away
somewhere.  "Sprenkel told me it was just possible
that Master Tyndale would be fettered, since it
was Schouts' custom to put all his prisoners into
irons.  That's why I came prepared.  Go on your
errand quickly, and God speed you.  I will start on
these irons at once."
</p>

<p>
While Herman was groping his way along the
passage the forester worked hard to relieve Tyndale
of that incubus which made free movement an
impossibility.  But his mind was on the younger
man's danger, and he thrilled at the almost certain
consequences.
</p>

<p>
"He must not do that mad thing," he muttered,
rising from his knees and tossing the file on the
floor.
</p>

<p>
"He must not, my friend," said Tyndale weakly,
rousing himself from his stupor.
</p>

<p>
Engel did not pause, but hurried along the
passage with the lantern in his hand, leaving the
others in darkness.  He overtook Herman as he was
smoothing his hand over the stone door to find the
knob which would open it.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong?" Herman asked anxiously.
"Is Master Tyndale dead?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  But he has spoken, and he thinks with me
that you must not attempt this mad thing."
</p>

<p>
"I shall attempt it, none the less, Otto.  There's
food to be had, and I mean to get it.  The good
man's life is worth the risk.  The world has need of
him."
</p>

<p>
Herman fingered his dagger while he spoke, and
felt its point to know how keen it was, and Engel,
seeing the gleam in the other's eyes and the
determined look in his face as the light of the lantern
played on it, knew that it was vain to endeavour
to turn him from his purpose.
</p>

<p>
"Go softly, then," he whispered, while he, too,
felt about for the hidden spring.  "Ha! it is here.
I'll hide the light first, before we open the door."
</p>

<p>
He turned and saw a niche in the rock where the
lantern light would be completely shaded, if anyone
chanced to be in the passage.  Then, with his hand
again on the spring, he thrust the door away, barely,
while the two men peered through the slit.
</p>

<p>
The passage was dark and silent.  There was no
sound save the distant shouts of men who were
calling to each other in connection with the night's
piracy.
</p>

<p>
"Slip through and look the other way," the
ranger whispered, and Herman, venturing, stood in
the corridor.
</p>

<p>
"Go back and file away at those fetters," he
whispered back.
</p>

<p>
"Roye is there, and as I came away, although I
was leaving them in darkness, he was beginning
to work at them for dear life," the answer came.
</p>

<p>
A moment later Herman was alone, and the door
was drawn into its place, as it had been before, when
the search for the dungeon was being made.  The
passage was dark.  The page was somewhere in
that part of the castle still.  He must have thought
he had been dreaming about the streak of light
across the floor, for now he was whistling lustily,
and breaking off for an occasional snatch of song.
The increasing faintness of these sounds assured
Herman that the boy was going farther and farther
away, somewhere in that part where the steps led
down to the now empty dungeon.
</p>

<p>
Going forward to the banqueting-hall, taking
every step in stealth, alert for any sound, and ever
on the watch for any token of approaching danger,
Herman came to the place where he thought the door
of the great chamber should be.  He paused when he
saw a narrow line of light on the floor of the passage,
and, going nearer to know what it meant, he found
that the light was streaming through a slit in the
doorway of the place where he had seen the food.
</p>

<p>
When his hand touched the door, he paused to
listen, to glance both ways along the corridor; but
there was nothing to indicate that anyone was
moving about.  Growing confident, he pushed the door
a little wider open and peeped in.  The chamber
was empty, and it was all as he had seen it before.
Food lay on the tables set there, either for supper
or in readiness for the early morning meal.  It
seemed to Herman that all he had to do was to step
in quickly, take a wine flagon from one of the tables,
a dish of bread, and one of the roasted fowls.
</p>

<p>
It was a bold thing to do, but so was everything
he had been doing in this night's enterprise.  He
thought of William Tyndale's need, and knew that,
unless he did something such as this, his escape
would hardly be possible, seeing that he was so weak.
</p>

<p>
Opening the door widely, that his movements
might be unhampered, he walked to the table, going
so rapidly that his feet, with all his attempt at
stealth, fell with what seemed to him sharp, loud
taps upon the tessellated floor.  He was within a yard
of the spot where he could lay his hand on the things
he wanted, when his heart leapt at what he saw.
The door at the other end of the banqueting-hall
opened, and someone entered.  In a moment
Herman pulled his cap low over his eyes, throwing
a shadow on his face.
</p>

<p>
The man who stepped in was Cochlaeus, and as he
stood just within the doorway, and the light fell on
him, Herman saw that his face was a frowning one,
as though he took offence at the treatment that was
meted out to a man of his quality and importance
among Churchmen&mdash;that he should be set aside to
await the lord of the castle's leisure while he busied
himself with piracy.
</p>

<p>
Herman's hand stole to his dagger, in readiness to
use it, if need arose.  The impulse came to turn at
once and walk away, hoping that Cochlaeus would
not see and recognise him.  Before he came to a
decision, the Deacon looked up and saw that
someone was in the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Hi, varlet!" he cried peremptorily.  "Come
and wait on me!  This lord of yours has no respect
for those who come to see him, for he must needs
go on with his godless pursuits, while I am wasting
my time, and faint with hunger."
</p>

<p>
The words came angrily, but so far it was plain
that Cochlaeus had not recognised Herman.  He
was intensely relieved.  Could he not play a bolder
game?
</p>

<p>
"Sit, sir, at my lord's table, and let me wait on
you," he answered, in a simulated voice.  "But I
must carry this away first, lest there be trouble at
my slackness."
</p>

<p>
He went forward to a table, and easily, recklessly,
indeed, he caught up a great dish of varied meats
when he had placed a fowl there, and heaped bread
on it.  With this and a heavy flagon full of wine,
he turned his back on Cochlaeus, and walked to the
door by which he had entered.
</p>

<p>
"Be quick, fellow!" cried the other, who by this
time had seated himself at the cross table where
Schouts always sat.  "I told you I was starving.
Canst not serve me first and see to that later?"
</p>

<p>
The man's voice rang down the hall impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"I dare not!  'Tis more than one's life is worth
in this castle," Herman called back with assumed
ease; but his heart was beating tumultuously.
With a swift look up the banqueting-chamber to
see that none had been watching him besides the
heretic hunter, and then with glances as keen each
way in the corridor, Herman went at a run, regardless
of his sounding steps.
</p>

<p>
"Here," came the ranger's whisper, as the door
opened wide, and Herman, with an ejaculation of
thankfulness, stepped through the doorway.  He
heard the thud of the heavy stone coming into its
place, and the click of the latch before he turned.
</p>

<p>
"Safe again, and God be praised!" exclaimed the
forester, reaching for the lantern and looking at
the load which Herman carried.  "And successful,
too!" he cried, a ring of satisfaction in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"There's plenty for us all," said Herman quietly,
now realising the strain this bold venture had placed
on him.  "Lead the way, Otto, and let us get back
to Master Tyndale."
</p>

<p>
He felt that for a little while, at all events, he did
not want to speak.  His mind was not so much on
the danger he had faced as on that man who was
the instigator of all this trouble, and he marvelled
at his escape from recognition since more than once
he had confronted Cochlaeus in the city, and had
been compelled to do business with him.  Each
step in that short walk towards William Tyndale
served to restore his confidence, and as Engel went
before him silently, holding the lantern low down,
so that the light fell on the path showing him where
to tread, he was becoming his old self again.
</p>

<p>
"Wert seen at all?" asked the ranger presently,
wondering at Herman's silence.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and by Cochlaeus."
</p>

<p>
"What!  By Cochlaeus?" the other cried,
gasping out the words, and turning round so
unexpectedly that the dish Herman was carrying was
barely saved, and some of the wine in the full
flagon was spilt on the path.  "Did he know
thee?" he exclaimed, staring at Herman and
lifting the lantern to see his face.
</p>

<p>
The question amused Herman, and he chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"He came into the banqueting-hall while I was
there.  The fellow had a scowl on his face&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I never saw him without one," Engel ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  But it was a more than usually savage
one this time, for he was hungry.  But go on.
Think of Master Tyndale's need.  I can tell it as we
move forward."
</p>

<p>
The forester led the way again, and Herman,
having given him the flagon to carry, went on with
his story.
</p>

<p>
"His dignity had been offended because Schouts
had gone to his pirate work, instead of pursuing
that bargain concerning Master Tyndale.  He took
me for one of the varlets, and bade me serve him
with food."
</p>

<p>
Herman stopped and laughed aloud, and the
ranger, turning, saw his face and laughed with him.
</p>

<p>
"Didst take him any?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, he's there, waiting for me," Herman cried,
moving forward.
</p>

<p>
They laughed until the place rang, for there was
no need for restraint since no one inside the castle
could overhear them.  Tyndale, who had been
sitting in helplessness while Roye was filing at the
irons in the dark, and feeling his work with his
fingers, heard the sounds of laughter, and it was
cheering to him.
</p>

<p>
"There is good news, Roye!" he exclaimed.
"They have met with no mishap, for which I thank
God, or they would not have come back in such high
spirits.  And I would be glad to have food, for I feel
faint."
</p>

<p>
He spoke weakly, but when he saw Herman and
his companion, coming back with the lantern, which
the forester held aloof, he saw their faces and the
dish in Herman's hands.
</p>

<p>
"You seem merry," he said, but already better
for the assurance that some of the danger had
passed.
</p>

<p>
"We are!" exclaimed Herman, stepping forward
quickly.  At Tyndale's side he dropped on his
knees and set the food on the floor.  He wondered
when he saw that already Roye had taken the irons
from his hands and had begun with the rings about
Tyndale's feet.
</p>

<p>
"Drink some of this wine first," said Herman,
and by this time the forester had gone to Tyndale's
other side and had him in his arms, holding him up
while the younger man put the flagon to the sick
one's lips.  He drank a little, and then with care
they fed him, and to give him confidence, as well as
to fall in with his wishes, they ate with him, for
Herman had brought enough and to spare.
</p>

<p>
When they had eaten, and Tyndale seemed already
so much better, they faced the difficulties of the
present and the immediate future.  Tyndale had
been brought out of the dungeon, but what should
the next step be?  It would soon be known that he
had escaped, and the forest would be searched
through and through, not only by Cochlaeus and
the City Guard, but by the robber lord who had
lost a prize that was worth to him at least a
thousand golden crowns.
</p>

<p>
"If I take you to my place, Master Tyndale, they
may go there, and they would not fail to find you,
and then!"
</p>

<p>
The forester shrugged his shoulders and thought
of the end of this man for whom they had dared so
much, to say nothing of their own penalty for aiding
him.
</p>

<p>
"What can be done?" asked Tyndale quietly.
"It seems to me that I am compelled to take the
risks."
</p>

<p>
The future appeared very black as they talked
over a dozen plans, every one of which had a spot in
it of weakness and the certainty of a disastrous
ending.  But presently the forester, who had done
as he was wont to do when in perplexity, came back
to the little group after having walked to and fro,
wrapped in thought.
</p>

<p>
"What say you if I leave you here with the others
to bear you company, while I go about my business
as though nothing had happened?  I might even
play my part and help the people at the castle&mdash;ay! and
that rascal, Cochlaeus&mdash;in their search for
you.  But I warrant you 'twill be a vain one.  I'd
be very diligent for the Churchman."
</p>

<p>
The cavern rang with the forester's laughter,
and he laughed till the tears came, and his body
ached when he thought of the chase he would lead
them if they suffered him to share in the search.
</p>

<p>
"I'll bring you food in plenty from time to time,
and meanwhile I can think things out and see how
we can contrive to get you away.  Art willing,
Master Tyndale?" he asked, becoming serious.
</p>

<p>
"I am willing," came the answer; "but I am
loth to keep these with me cooped up in the
darkness&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You shall have light in plenty," the forester
interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"But Herman&mdash;think what it means to him, with
Margaret Byrckmann waiting for him and
wondering what has become of him."
</p>

<p>
"I'll send her word," said Engel seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Had I but paper and ink, I could have gone on
with my work," said Tyndale.  "I should have been
using up my hours, and this task would be so much
nearer to completion.  Roye could have written
while I dictated."
</p>

<p>
"So he shall.  I know a priest who is a man of
letters, and I can tell him some story which will
induce him to give me both pen and paper," said
the forester, disposing of that difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"As for me," said Herman, longing though he was
to go back to Margaret, if only to see her for an hour,
but feeling that, so far as duty went, it was here, by
Tyndale's side&mdash;"as for me, I shall stay and keep
watch if Otto Engel will only set you going on your
work, Master Tyndale!" he exclaimed earnestly.
</p>

<p>
Engel went just before day-dawn, but he came
in the middle of the afternoon with a basket.  It
contained food, for which they were grateful, but
Tyndale's eyes gleamed at the sight of a bundle of
paper, some ink, and a store of quills.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" he ejaculated.  "Ay, and my
dear friend, thank you as well, from the bottom of
my heart.  There need be no hurry now, for with
light and these I am as well off here as in a palace.
What care I for comfort if my hand is not stayed in
my God-given task?"
</p>

<p>
His eyes gleamed with pleasure as he turned over
the sheets and drew out the books from his wallet.
But he thought of Herman.
</p>

<p>
"My son, since I am safe here, you may steal away
at night, and you know your way by that secret
entrance to your home; and after that it will be easy
to pass through the streets to where the girl you
love dwells with her father."
</p>

<p>
Herman took his outstretched hand in his.
</p>

<p>
"I'll think about it," he answered softly, the love-light
in his eyes.  "I should like to go, but my duty
is here, and she knows I am with you."
</p>

<p>
"Is there any news of the castle?" Herman
asked a moment later, turning to Engel, who was
trimming the lantern.
</p>

<p>
"News?" exclaimed the forester.  "I should
think there was.  Schouts came to terms with
Cochlaeus when he had cleared out the ship and
sent her away empty, and then, so Sprenkel told me,
they went to the dungeon so that the pious Churchman
might see his prisoner.  I'd have given something
to see them going down those slippery steps,
and would have hoped for a fall for both of them.
But I would have given a week's wages to have seen
their faces when they stepped into that horrible
dungeon and found that the prisoner was gone!
</p>

<p>
"Sprenkel was with them, and he told me that
Cochlaeus stamped about on the filthy floor, beside
himself with rage.  He swung round presently and
faced Schouts like a madman, then shook his fist at
him, and declared that he had been playing with him.
And as for Schouts, who thought of the thousand
crowns he had lost, when they seemed so certain,
his anger blazed out at the Churchman's insults,
and, lifting his great fist, he would have struck
him down but for a remnant of superstition still
lingering in his godless heart.
</p>

<p>
"'But for the fact that you are a priest, I would
have you chained where that Englishman lay!' he
cried.
</p>

<p>
"He caught the lamp from Sprenkel's hand, and
went to the wall where the iron ring had been torn
away.  He was almost speechless with astonishment,
and the more so because he had marked, when he
ordered Tyndale to be carried to the dungeon, how
frail he was.
</p>

<p>
"Sprenkel told me that Cochlaeus raged and
stormed, and vowed every curse on Schouts and his
retainers that the Church could heap upon them,
until, in his anger, Schouts gripped him at the back
of his neck, hurried the Churchman up the steps
and along the corridors, then to the gate, which
the warden opened in amazement at his call.  There,
without a word, he hurled him from him, and
Cochlaeus, staggering half-way across the drawbridge,
fell in a helpless heap, while the portcullis
fell, and the gate closed with a clang."
</p>

<p>
The forester's face seemed aglow with delight, as
he stood with folded arms and his back against the
cavern wall.
</p>

<p>
"I've something more to tell you," he said, after
a pause.  "I was walking through the forest soon
after I left you here, and, hearing the sounds of
voices, the stamp of horses' hoofs, and the jingle of
harness and steel, I moved about as I usually do
when I am out on duty.
</p>

<p>
"'Hi, fellow!' someone cried, and, turning, I saw
Cochlaeus and the City Guard.  The Churchman,
now on horseback, and greatly ruffled, demanded
my name.
</p>

<p>
"'I'm Otto Engel, your reverence,' I answered,
'and I am ranger of the forest.'
</p>

<p>
"'In the pay of that robber lord in the castle?'
he asked me.
</p>

<p>
"'Nay; I do not work for him, but for a master
whom I love.'
</p>

<p>
"'Hast seen anyone in the forest&mdash;an Englishman&mdash;that
heretic fellow whom they call William
Tyndale?  He was a prisoner in the castle, but
has got away, and must be hiding somewhere.'
</p>

<p>
"'When was that?' I asked, as simply as I
knew how, and with such an air of surprise that
he never thought to ask me again if I had seen
the man.
</p>

<p>
"'Any time during the night,' the answer came,
and at once he made an offer which set my blood
dancing.  'See, ranger, if thou canst find him for
us, that limb of Satan, there are a hundred golden
crowns for you, and the blessing of the Church.'
</p>

<p>
"I put on my face a look of greed, or what I
thought was one, with such an offer.
</p>

<p>
"'Wilt come with me and I will show you places
where a man might think to hide,' I said.  'But if I
fail to find him I get nothing, and I lose the hundred
crowns.'
</p>

<p>
"'Nay.  Thou shalt have ten, but it will be my
joy if I have to pay thee the full hundred,' Cochlaeus
cried.
</p>

<p>
"They followed me, the whole of the City Guard
and Cochlaeus&mdash;the Churchman eager, the other
horsemen in ill-humour, for they were hungry after
a long night's fast, and worn out with their long
waiting at the castle gate, for the coming of the
Deacon.  How he had come out I had not heard then,
for it was later when I met Sprenkel.
</p>

<p>
"We searched everywhere, in places likely and
unlikely, once in the lair of a bear who made her
onslaught on us, and had to be dealt with by cold
steel, and once again I sent them down an alley in the
forest where a couple of wolves leapt out, and there
were snarls and snaps, and then unearthly yells,
as the wild creatures fell before the deadly sword
thrusts.
</p>

<p>
"'We'll go to the city!' cried Cochlaeus, who
rode swiftly back to where I was awaiting them, with
my hunting-knife in readiness in case any of those
yelping, slouching beasts should get away and turn
on me.  'Here are the ten crowns I promised,'
he added, handing me the golden pieces with a
trembling hand.  'But see, fellow, I spoke of a
hundred crowns.  Find me this William Tyndale
and I will give you a hundred and fifty; but he
must be alive, so that we may deal with him for his
heresy and his pestilential work.'
</p>

<p>
"I took the gold, and watched them ride away.
Some of the horsemen were wiping the blood from
their swords, and most of them were sitting in their
saddles in discontent, and gazing after the Churchman
with a contempt one rarely has the chance of
seeing.  I stood looking after them till they had
gone out of sight, when someone slapped me on the
shoulder.  Whoever it was, he had come on me
unawares, and I swung round to find myself face to
face with Sprenkel.  I told him what I knew, and
then I heard of what had passed in the castle.  But
here are the crowns, Master Tyndale, and shall I
tell thee what I think it best to do with them?"
</p>

<p>
Tyndale looked at him curiously.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say."
</p>

<p>
"I thought that you should have them, and use
them for the work you have in hand.  They would
go some little distance towards printing that Word
of God, and it would be safe to do so, since it would
be but spoiling the Egyptians."
</p>

<p>
Tyndale hesitated; but at last, when the forester
protested that he would not touch the money, he
put out his hand, took the coins, and dropped them
in his wallet.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas not God's money when you had it," he
said simply, "but I will take it as His money now,
and use it for the glory of God."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Far on into the night, while Tyndale was telling
of his hopes, a night-bird's cry came, and the eyes
of those who were in the cavern turned towards
the tree which formed the entrance to their hiding-place.
</p>

<p>
"I believe that's Engel," said Herman, springing
to his feet, but at the same time fingering the
dagger at his belt, alert for any danger.  Before
many moments had passed the ranger came in,
shaking his dress into place as he stepped forward
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Come at once!" he exclaimed, before he reached
them.  "And take up your master's wallet, Roye.
I have a boat down by the river which will carry
you across to the other bank.  I know of a hiding-place
in the forest where I cannot think that rascal
of a Cochlaeus can ever find you, Master Tyndale,
and when it is safe to do so, later on, we may get
you to the place you want to reach."
</p>

<p>
There was a strange look on the man's face as
he drew out of his bosom a heavy purse.
</p>

<p>
"If this be not God's way, I wot not what to call
it!" he exclaimed, his voice tremulous with deep
feeling.  "I have heard my mother tell how, when
the Israelites went up out of Egypt to go to the
Land of Promise&mdash;I think she called it that&mdash;they
spoiled the Egyptians, and got much from them
for their desert journey.  What shall we say of
this, Master Tyndale?  Your enemies have sought
to hinder your work, and worse, they mean to
kill you if they can.  Yet I watched that man
Cochlaeus, who was resting at the foot of one of
the trees, and he was fingering a purse and took
out the ten crowns which I brought here.  I thought
no more about it, but when I passed that way to
make things ready for your escape, Master Tyndale,
my foot kicked against something, and it was that
same purse.  Here it is!  It must have dropped
from his bosom while he rose to mount into his
saddle.  'Tis God's gift.  I'm sure of it!  Twill
pay the charges for a comfortable journey, and
leave much over for your future wants."
</p>

<p>
The forester opened the purse, which was very
heavy, and there was the gleam of gold.  It was
money in abundance, and Tyndale, taking it from
Engel's hands, went on his knees.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
THE FLIGHT FROM THE HOLY HOUSE
</h3>

<p>
For the whole of that long day which followed
Margaret's next awaking, no one came to
see her.  They who kept the prison thought
that the jar of water and the loaf would
keep her from starvation, and it was evidently no
part of their plan to make her comfortable.  But the
bird who had been before came to her, peeped into
the cell between the window-bars, twisted his little
head inquiringly, and waited almost expectantly.
</p>

<p>
Margaret watched him, and wondered whether
he had been fed by the prisoner who last lodged in
this dismal place.  Breaking off some of the soft
part of her loaf, and having crumbled it in her
hands, she approached the window.  The bird was
cautious, and drew back to the other side of the
bars, where he was free to fly away if Margaret
meditated any treachery.  There he watched warily,
twisting his head all ways, while she spread the
crumbs on the stone sill.
</p>

<p>
She hoped he would come while she stood near,
but he contented himself with peering and chirping
impatiently, as if to ask her to drop back, and she
understood.  She stepped away to the middle of
the cell, and when she did so he came forward to
peck at the food until the last crumb had gone.
By way of thanks he sang a song to the lonely
prisoner, and flew away.
</p>

<p>
The loneliness that followed was unutterable.
The hours dragged on, intolerable in their slowness.
They must have been leaden-footed&mdash;the slowest
hours that Time ever dealt out!
</p>

<p>
Night came again, and still there was no visit
from the men who were so silent and forbidding
when they were with her.  There was no fresh
supply of food because of their absence, but the loaf
was not gone, nor was the water-jar quite empty.
But these facts did not go far to lessen her anxiety
about the future, for the question came to her as
to whether this was the only food she was to have.
The stories afloat in the city were that that was
often the practice with the Inquisitors; they
brought food at the start, just once, and no more,
and then the victims were left to slow starvation,
or so weakened by hunger and thirst that, when
torture came, they collapsed.
</p>

<p>
But why was she here?  Who could have suspected
her of heresy by anything she had ever said or done
outside her own pretty room at home?  These
Familiars were like bloodhounds.  They could
scent out heresy as surely as the hounds could
smell a hunted man; and possibly they had
discovered that she had befriended William Tyndale&mdash;had
even been one of the two to bring him into
the city.
</p>

<p>
She sat and wept at the thought.  She wept as
well to think that when her wedding day came she
would not be at her father's house as bride.  Her
heart went out in yearning for Herman, whom she
so dearly loved.  She thought of his consternation
and his grief when he found that she had not
returned.  It was more for him than for herself, and
her misery at being lodged in this dreary place
with no prospect but death.
</p>

<p>
Morning came with her silver light again, and the
crucifix came slowly into view; and the face of the
Saviour was full of sorrow.  It matched her own
unhappiness.  The light of the dawn showed her
how small her supply of food was.  She was intensely
thirsty, but she felt she must husband both bread
and water.  She was afraid to do more than moisten
her lips and swallow a mouthful to take the dryness
from her parched throat.  The bread had woefully
dwindled, for the rats had been at it, and one or
two scrambled across the floor when she flung out
her hands to drive them away.  The bird came for
his meal, and she could not deny him; and in payment
for it he sang a song which brought the tears; for
it set her thinking of freedom, and made her yearn
for it more than words could ever tell.
</p>

<p>
The loneliness, with nothing to do but think
and pray, was intolerable.  She was realising that
it is never good for one to feel the sense of being
absolutely alone, for one would grow morbid, and
distort the realities, and become fearful or bitter,
as she feared she would do.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps that was a part of her torture.  It was
possible that the Inquisitors knew from their
experience with other prisoners that loneliness was as
much of pain in its way as the use of the thumbscrew
or the hot pincers.  Whether they did so or
not, she felt that to the lonely one, robbed of
liberty and companionship, the choicest and most
entrancing spot on earth, "the valley of flowers
and the hills of glory," becomes a desert which in
time is peopled with horror and a deadly fear.  How
much more this dungeon in which she was lying!
</p>

<p>
When evening drew on, the shadows grew deeper
in the cell.  The crucifix was presently barely
visible, and Margaret shuddered; for it seemed to
her that the noisome creatures of the place were
coming out of their hiding now that the light was
going.  Her heart leapt at a sound she heard, but
she knew not whether to hope or fear.  There was
the noise of a key in the lock as she had heard it
before, followed by the dropping of the bars and
chains and the drawing of bolts.  Then, with a
slowness that was trying to her nerves, the door
began to open.
</p>

<p>
Two Familiars entered, one blocking up the doorway,
in case the prisoner should try to rush through
in the wild hope of finding liberty.
</p>

<p>
The other approached the straw on which Margaret
sat, looking up at the cowled creature wistfully,
with her hands folded, the once rosy cheeks no
longer coloured, but white and wan.  If this man
who came disguised in that ugly cowl had known
that to-morrow was her bridal day, he must have
thought that there was nothing here suggestive of
a happy bride as she crouched at his feet.  His
black robe rustled on the straw, sweeping across it
when he bent to set another loaf and a jar of water
on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Not one word passed.  Of what avail was it to
ask these men why she was here?  They would not
deign an answer, of that she was sure.
</p>

<p>
When this one who brought the food was once
more at the door, he turned to speak.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow you are to appear in the Audience
Chamber to answer certain questions concerning
that Englishman, William Tyndale.  If you do not
answer satisfactorily, so I am told to say, you will
be put to the torture."
</p>

<p>
"To the torture?" she cried.
</p>

<p>
She shivered at the word, and buried her face in
her hands, while the Familiars passed away, taking
no notice of her cry.
</p>

<p>
"Torture!" she moaned again, when she was alone.
</p>

<p>
She needed not to be told what was embodied
in that word which thrilled the hearts of the most
hardened with horror, and none ever asked what
form it would take, since all had heard of the rack,
and red-hot irons, and the pulley.
</p>

<p>
She was determined on one thing through those
long night hours, when she was too distressed to eat
and drink, although she was so hungry and thirsty.
Whatever came, she would not betray William
Tyndale.
</p>

<p>
She sat and rocked herself in the extremity of her
dread, but after a time she rose from her seat and,
kneeling, prayed.  She felt that she could pray
better in that posture, but the time which followed
made the cell like a Gethsemane to her.  She
prayed as He did who hung upon the cross.  She
wanted the cup to pass from her, if it were possible.
Those were her "hours of amazement"&mdash;hours of
darkest, deepest midnight, when her heart recoiled
from the promised suffering.
</p>

<p>
She was kneeling thus when she heard a sound,
and she looked up quickly, wondering whether the
Familiars were returning to tell her something more.
She had not noticed it, but the moon was shining
through the window, and as she turned to look, the
shaft of light seemed broken, and something moved,
a dark shadow like a man's fingers closing round the
bars; then something like a man's head appeared,
and a voice followed immediately.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-200"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-200.jpg" alt="SHE SAW A MAN'S FINGERS CLOSING ROUND THE BARS.">
<br>
SHE SAW A MAN'S FINGERS CLOSING ROUND THE BARS.
</p>

<p>
"Margaret Byrckmann, are you there?"
</p>

<p>
The voice was familiar, and she sprang to
her feet, overturning the jar of water as she
moved.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" she asked, not seeing the face,
which was in shadow.
</p>

<p>
"Heinrich.  You know poor Heinrich, do you
not?  I know you are Margaret Byrckmann, now
that you have spoken.  I know your voice, for it
has always spoken so kindly to poor Heinrich."
</p>

<p>
The voice was a man's, and yet there was so much
of the child in it.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you here, Heinrich?" Margaret asked,
going close to the window and putting up her hand
to touch his, for the sake of the companionship
after that long spell of loneliness.  It was something
to have this man, or this boy&mdash;this boy in a man's
strong frame&mdash;near to her.  She waited for his
answer, wondering whether he had brought any
message from her father or Herman.
</p>

<p>
"I was in the cavern and saw them take you
away.  They carried you because you were senseless,
so I heard one of the Familiars say.  I tried to stop
them, thinking I might get you out of their hands,
and I lay in their way across the dark path.  Not
seeing me, they stumbled over me and fell.  Oh,
how they cursed me!
</p>

<p>
"I did not do that again, for I thought that
another fall would hurt you, lame you, perhaps; but
I followed to see where they put you, but when once
they carried you through their private door I could
discover no more, for they locked me out.  But I
meant to find out.  I have been trying to do so all
these days and nights.  I have gone from window to
window, and now, God be praised!  I have found
you!  Let me kiss your hand&mdash;that beautiful hand
that never did me anything but kindness!"
</p>

<p>
He bent his lips to her fingers and kissed them
passionately.
</p>

<p>
"Why have you come, Heinrich?  Have you
brought me a message from anyone?" Margaret
asked, hoping that he would mention Herman's name.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I have not left this accursed house, save
to run home for something to eat and drink, and I
have brought this."
</p>

<p>
He drew something out of his bosom, and laid its
rough surface on Margaret's soft hand.
</p>

<p>
"A file!" she exclaimed, thrilled with a hope that
came when she realised what it meant.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I am going to file away these bars and get
you out of that den.  I will take you where they will
never find you.  Move your hand, lest I may hurt
you."
</p>

<p>
Heinrich began to work at the bars like one
possessed, and Margaret, standing near, could hear
how the file bit into the iron.  In the stillness of the
night the sound was alarmingly loud to her, and she
was afraid that someone would hear and come to
ask the meaning of it.  Now and again Heinrich
paused to look around, to know whether he was
seen, or anyone approached.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he set the file on the sill.
</p>

<p>
"The City Guard!  Go on filing quietly.  I'll
come back."  He dropped away from the window,
and Margaret was alone again.
</p>

<p>
Using the file, she worked at the bar until her
arms ached; but what mattered that?  Was not
liberty to come in payment for the toil?  But
Heinrich was so long away that she was afraid he
had gone for good, and perhaps she would not
escape at all.  He returned, however, when the
lane was clear and silent again, and, after working
at each bar in succession, he exclaimed in exultation
when his strong hand tore away the last one,
and the space was open.
</p>

<p>
"Can you climb up on your side?" he asked,
thrusting his head and shoulders through the
opening and looking down into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"I think so," Margaret said doubtfully, for the
window was high from the floor.  "But you must
give me your hand."  Her hands came up to him out
of the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," the man whispered.  "I will come
down and give you a lift up.  When you are where
I am, you can drop down into the lane."
</p>

<p>
Telling Margaret to stand aside, he glanced up
and down the lane to see that the way was clear;
then he drew himself up, crawled through the
opening, and dropped into the cell.  Before she
knew what he meant to do, he had her in his strong
arms, and, lifting her lightly, he placed her on the
sill, where the bird's meal had been served.
</p>

<p>
"How deep is it down to the lane?" she asked,
for the moon had gone behind the cloud, and she
was looking into blackness.  "I'm afraid to drop."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't.  Make as much room for me as
you can," Heinrich whispered up to her.  "I'll
climb up and let you down easily."
</p>

<p>
Before many seconds had passed he had scrambled
up, and was squeezing his body between her and
the wall, crushing her against the side of the deep
opening, but chuckling at his success.  But he
stopped, and almost roughly he pushed past
Margaret and dropped into the lane.
</p>

<p>
She understood, and her hair seemed to lift and
her heart to stand still, for from the cell from whence
she had just been lifted came the sounds of dropping
bars and the turning of a lock.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, for the love of Heaven!" Heinrich
called to her in a whisper.  "Drop into my arms.
They are strong, and I will catch you!"
</p>

<p>
She moved on the instant and fell into the
strong arms of the man below.  He caught her
as though she had been no weight at all, and before
he set her on her feet he carried her across the lane
into the dark shadows, where they could not be
seen, and then he put her down.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me," he panted, out of breath; and,
taking her hand, he ran with her, on and on, now
down the lane, and always keeping in the dark,
now through a gateway and across a garden belonging
to one of the city merchants, down a narrow
alley where, if they had gone side by side, Margaret
would have scraped her arms against the wall, then
across a broad street, deserted save by the City
Guard, whose measured step sounded and whose
gleaming halberds could be seen as they passed a
huge bonfire which blazed in the market-place to
allay infection, since the Burgomaster and City
Fathers feared the coming of the plague.
</p>

<p>
Heinrich did not pause, and Margaret, longing to
escape the clutches of the Inquisitors, never asked
him where he was taking her.  The thought which
absorbed her was liberty; and that remembrance of
the sound of the shooting bolts and the fear that the
Familiars, when they found that she was gone, would
pursue her, using the window as she had done,
made her feel that she would go anywhere, yes,
anywhere, rather than fall into their cruel hands.
</p>

<p>
"On, Heinrich, on!  I hear them coming!" she
exclaimed, when her companion slackened his pace
a little, and, still holding him by the hand, she
went beyond him and dragged him forward.  "Oh,
do not lag behind!" she added, panting.
</p>

<p>
"The danger is gone now," the other said,
detaining her.  "They do not see us, and they have no
notion as to the way we took.  I am taking you to
a place where they will never find you."
</p>

<p>
Heinrich turned down a dark lane, still holding
her by the hand and patting it reassuringly.  His
quiet confidence restored her confidence, and she
was content to go his pace.
</p>

<p>
At last he came to a ramshackle building.  It
might have been an old cart-house, or a place where
cows were lodged, or a stable.  At another time
she would have hesitated to be drawn into such a
darkness, especially as she could not discern what
the place was like; but the instinct of flight
disposed her to disregard everything in the way
of doubt.  She thought of nothing but that one
purpose, to get away from those minions who had
threatened her with the torture chamber.
</p>

<p>
Going slowly, lest Margaret should stumble, and
holding her firmly by the hand to lead her round
obstacles which he knew of and which she could
not see, Heinrich stopped suddenly.  Margaret
could feel, although she could not see, that he was
bending forward.  Then he tapped sharply three or
four times.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?" came a woman's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Mother, I am here.  Open the door."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
THE MILL IN THE FOREST
</h3>

<p>
When Tyndale and his companions stood
on the river bank, after having quitted
the cavern, there was no sign of any
boat such as the forester had spoken of.
</p>

<p>
"I've come wide of the mark," said Engel, after
looking up and down the stream as if to get his
bearings.  "Yes; but I see now.  We must go a
bit to the left and then we shall find Brunow, who
said he would wait until we came."
</p>

<p>
The others started when they saw a black form
rise as if coming out of the water.
</p>

<p>
"Who goes there?" came a quiet but manly
toned challenge.
</p>

<p>
"Otto Engel.  Is anybody about?" the forester
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I can see.  The pirate lord up yonder
has found enough booty to last two or three nights,
and there is not so much as a sentinel at the
landing-stage.  Still, don't linger.  I'd like to get away.
One never knows who may be about.  Which is the
Englishman?"
</p>

<p>
"I am," said Tyndale, going closer to the boatman,
and before long he was seated in the flat-bottomed
boat, and, the others having stepped into
it, the forester was helping to pull to the other
bank.
</p>

<p>
"Now 'tis easy going, please God," said Engel,
when they stepped out on the meadow and the
boatman made his craft fast.
</p>

<p>
"I'd not be too sure of it!" he exclaimed, "and
it were best to be alert when such an one as Cochlaeus
is on the quest for anybody tainted with heresy."
</p>

<p>
The boatman stood in his boat and looked about
him, and they could barely see his movements in
the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"It's well that there was no moon while we
were crossing, but I think she's coming.  If you
hurry over the meadow you may reach the forest
yonder before she comes away from those clouds
which look like breaking up.  And we are not
likely presently to have a very dark night."
</p>

<p>
"We'll go at once," said Engel, and, bidding
Tyndale take his arm since it would help him,
and telling Roye to carry the wallet, he bade
the boatman "good-night," and moved across the
meadow.
</p>

<p>
They had barely entered the forest when the
moon swept out into a sky where broken clouds
began to drift, and the meadow they had crossed,
as likewise the river, and again beyond it the
forest where the castle stood, were in the full flood
of silver light, only obscured for a few moments as
a cloud veiled the moon.  They paused to watch the
scene, and then they exclaimed almost with one
voice:
</p>

<p>
"Only just in time!"
</p>

<p>
Out of the forest they had quitted some horsemen
rode into the open, close by where they had stepped
into the boat.  Steel glanced at every movement,
and so plainly did everything come into view that
they saw one of the horsemen looking around from
beneath the hand which shaded his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The City Guard!" cried Herman.
</p>

<p>
"And Cochlaeus, so I think!" exclaimed the
forester, who was bending forward, watching every
movement.  "But what is that?"
</p>

<p>
Three or four great flat-bottomed boats were
floating down the stream, and the horseman who
was scanning the landscape beckoned to the men
who were in them.  What was said it was impossible
to tell, but what followed thrilled them with a
deadly fear.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't expect anything like that," muttered
the forester, after watching keenly.  "Do you see
what they are doing?  They must have seen or
heard us, for they mean to come to this side of the
river.  See! the boats are drawn up at the bank,
which slopes in such a way that the horses can be
got into them!"
</p>

<p>
Tyndale and his companions seemed rooted to the
spot.  They knew that it was dangerous to linger,
yet they found it impossible to get away until they
saw in which direction the horsemen would travel
when once they touched the other bank.
</p>

<p>
The great boats, filled with horses and men,
came slowly over the water, watched by the unseen
fugitives, who were fascinated with their movements.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we not do well to be moving?" said
Tyndale presently, when the first boat ran up to
the bank and the riders, leaping out, began to land
their horses.
</p>

<p>
"Best to wait now, I think," said the forester
quietly.  "If we watch the direction they take
we can go in another, and so avoid them."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," Tyndale responded, and they
waited in such silence that every night sound in
the forest could be heard&mdash;the roar of some prowling
beast breaking the silence, and the weird and
startling cry of a night bird.  But even that went
by unnoticed in the anxiety of those minutes of
watching.
</p>

<p>
The last horse came on the bank, and before
long, while the boats drifted back again into the
current, the horsemen mounted into their saddles,
and, gathering up their reins, waited for the next
command.  It came, for before long every horse was
on the move, and steel helmets and steel trappings
glanced in the moonlight as the cavalcade moved
onward.
</p>

<p>
"They are moving away from us, thank God!"
exclaimed the forester in a tone of intense relief.
"They think, if they are after us, and they must
be! that we should make for the beaten pathway,
and they mean to take it themselves.  This way,
then!"
</p>

<p>
The forester took Tyndale's hand, and pulled it
through his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Lean hard on me, Master Tyndale.  God willing,
we shall give Cochlaeus and his men the slip.  I
think I know this forest better than any of them,
and I can take you by paths they have never seen.
So I say, 'Thank God for the moonlight.'  Now,
art ready?"
</p>

<p>
The forest was a dangerous place to travel by
night, when the wild creatures, the bears, the wolves,
the boars, and wild dogs, were out for food.  But
they would scarcely face four men, each with some
weapon, and moving in a compact little body, and
alert for every sound and chance encounter.  But
even then, since this was a matter of life and death,
there could be no thought of hesitation.
</p>

<p>
The last of the horsemen entered the broad forest
path when Engel began to move in the other direction,
away from them, and away, as he knew, from
the place to which he had meant to lead William
Tyndale.  They went on and on, not going too
swiftly, lest they should tire too soon, and always
listening for the sound of horses' hoofs and anything
like the jingle of steel, in case Cochlaeus had changed
his course.  Engel led them into the dense shadows,
among the bushes, where, when the foliage screened
the moonlight, the darkness was blackness.  More
than once something rushed past them with a snarl
or a yelp, and sometimes they heard the jaws of
a wolf, or other creature, snap again and again.
Once, as the forester led Tyndale away to the left,
a wild boar sprang up at their feet, and the glint of
the moon through the break in the forest showed
them his flashing eyes and his foaming mouth as
he sprang away among the undergrowth.
</p>

<p>
"We are safe, Master Tyndale, since you prayed
before we started that God would have us in His
keeping," said Engel quietly; and Tyndale's
answer told him of his quiet assurance.
</p>

<p>
"I know it, Engel.  We shall yet praise God for
His protecting mercies."
</p>

<p>
They had travelled a good distance, and more than
once they had had to rest because Tyndale felt the
strain.  Yet so far there was no sign of Cochlaeus
and his soldiers.  Neither had anything human
crossed their path.  But at last they came to the
open country, and across the meadow was a great
windmill, now standing still, with no light within
to show that anyone was moving.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis my father's mill!" the forester exclaimed;
"and we may safely awake him, since you are
tired, Master Tyndale.  Some food and a rest will
do you good, for I am sure you can have but little
strength left."
</p>

<p>
"But what of those men who are on our track?"
said Tyndale anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"My father will set someone to keep watch, and
the country is open, so that no soldiers can come
on us unawares."
</p>

<p>
"But if they did?" Tyndale asked doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"A word the moment they appeared anywhere
out of the forest and we could get into the marshes,
and no horsemen, unless they knew the way, could
follow."
</p>

<p>
Tyndale assented, and gladly, for by this time he
was almost exhausted.  In a little while they had
crossed the meadow and stood at the mill door.
</p>

<p>
"Who's there?" came the call from an upper
window, when Engel had beaten loudly on the door.
</p>

<p>
"Otto, father, and some friends.  Be quick, for
we are in no small danger."
</p>

<p>
The head was drawn away from the window in
an instant, and before long the miller was standing
in the open doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" he exclaimed.  "You're welcome
since my son brings you here, although I do not
know you!"
</p>

<p>
He had a candle in his hand, and he led the way
into a kitchen, the forester staying to bar the door;
but he was not long away.
</p>

<p>
"Father, this is that Englishman, William
Tyndale, you may have heard of, whom Cochlaeus
is after, meaning to burn him if he can lay hands
on him."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! then thou'rt thrice welcome, Master
Tyndale.  I'd do aught to frustrate that Deacon
of the Church of the Blessed Virgin.  I shall never
forget the inroad he and his made in our homes."
</p>

<p>
The man's voice trembled, and he brushed his great
hand across his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You want food?" he asked, mastering his
emotion.  "I'll get it;" and ere long the travellers
were eating of the best he had to offer them.
</p>

<p>
"Lie down there, Master Tyndale, and you other
men over there.  I'll keep watch, and if any come
this way I'll awake you in good time, and my son
will take you to the marsh."
</p>

<p>
They slept in confidence with that assurance,
but scarcely two hours had gone when the miller
awoke them noisily.
</p>

<p>
"The horsemen have just come out of the forest,
and they are crossing the meadow.  Otto, take them
away, and bide on the island there.  'Tis safe enough,
if you're content to stay there till the danger is past."
</p>

<p>
By this time all were ready.
</p>

<p>
"My wallet!" exclaimed Tyndale anxiously, for
even in this stress of pursuit it was too precious to
be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"I have it," Roye answered, and he threw it
across his shoulder and stood waiting to be
gone.
</p>

<p>
Going out of the mill by a back door, they saw
the mere showing plainly in the moonlight.  The
sedges and reeds almost touched the wall, and
Otto Engel hesitated, for he knew the danger.
Even for him or his father, who knew the paths in
the marsh, it was perilous; but by going cautiously
he knew they could pass safely if the others would
do exactly as he said.  Otherwise it was death, and
he told them so.
</p>

<p>
"If the soldiers should see us they could not
overtake us, so be calm, and take your time.  Look
well to your footing, and we shall be safe."
</p>

<p>
He spoke with more confidence than he felt,
for it was a long time since he had gone into the
heart of the mere.
</p>

<p>
They moved on slowly, the forester telling them
what to do from time to time, and they traversed
the mere for fully fifty yards in safety, but
hearing the sounds of galloping hoofs and jingling
steel.
</p>

<p>
"We're safe now, unless they fire after us," said
Engel, speaking thus to reassure them, and pausing
for a moment to look behind.  "Even if they see
us you need have no fear, for they could not
follow."
</p>

<p>
He was turning to move on again, when a cry
escaped him involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
"They have seen us!  But what of that?" he
added.  "They cannot follow."
</p>

<p>
"They are going to try!" exclaimed Herman,
pointing to the horsemen who had come round to
the back of the mill.
</p>

<p>
"We'll put as much distance between ourselves
and them as possible," cried Engel, catching at
Tyndale's hand.  "Mark every word I say, and
each one repeat it as he does it to the one behind,
so that there will be no mistake."
</p>

<p>
They went on as swiftly as they dared along the
winding path, sometimes hidden by the sedges,
which in places rose high enough to shut off the
view, while they could not see the horsemen, neither
could they be seen until they stepped out again
into a clearer space.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p214"></a>
"Halt!" came the cry on the night air, and the
voice belonged to Cochlaeus.
</p>

<p>
"On!" exclaimed Engel, moving forward; but
a shot rang out, and then another, and yet a third,
and they could hear the hissing as the balls flew past
them.
</p>

<p>
"They have struck none of us, thank God!" said
Tyndale, moving on again with Engel, after an
involuntary pause.
</p>

<p>
The horsemen were in a group at the opening of
the path, helpless and baffled, while the little
company still moved on.
</p>

<p>
"We shall soon be safe," cried the forester.
"Another hundred yards and we can be at ease."
</p>

<p>
"But they may follow," said Herman.
</p>

<p>
"They will be mad if they do," was the answer;
but he had scarcely said as much when Engel's lips
parted with wonder.  "'Tis madness, surely.  'Tis
death to some of them!"
</p>

<p>
He spoke because three of the soldiers had the
audacity to try the path.  One led the way on his
horse, and another followed, with a third close
on his heels.  But the feet of the first horse
slipped and threw his rider into the midst of the
bog.
</p>

<p>
The scene which followed thrilled those who were
watching with horror; not Tyndale and his
companions only, but those who were grouped about
Cochlaeus.  The horse scrambled to his feet and
reached the solid ground, but the soldier of the
City Guard, throwing out his hands, implored the
others to come to his aid.  His voice travelled over
the marsh, and they heard his hands beat on the
slush in his frantic efforts to regain the meadow.
It was only possible to watch in helplessness, and
the marsh was swallowing him up.  The soldier was
ere long up to the armpits in the mire, but at last,
with a heartrending cry, he disappeared, and the
mud and water of the mere closed over him.
</p>

<p>
Tyndale and his companions watched in solemn
silence; then, when Otto Engel spoke, they turned
and followed him.  They moved along the tortuous
path, but halted behind a bank of rushes to see what
was being done.  They saw the horsemen turn
away, and slowly ride out of sight, not even staying
to speak to the miller.
</p>

<p>
The path ended at an open space of solid ground
hemmed in by thick bushes and heavily foliaged
willow trees, and to their amazement those who
followed Engel's leading saw a strongly built timber
hut, completely hidden from the view of any who
were in the country on the fringe of the marsh.
</p>

<p>
"You are safe here, Master Tyndale," said the
forester, as he flung the hut door open and bade his
companions enter.  "Neither Cochlaeus nor all the
Familiars going can ever find you here.  My father
will feed you, and if you will, Master Tyndale, you
may pursue your God-made task, working and
resting when you please."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
HERMAN'S RETURN
</h3>

<p>
Herman satisfied himself that Tyndale was
safe, and that everything was provided for
his comfort, before he started on his
journey home.  Once on the way, he
travelled in haste, but careful when he reached the
city not to show any signs of trepidation.  He passed
through the gateway just before the gloaming fell,
and the wardens gave him a friendly nod.
</p>

<p>
"How has your business prospered?" the chief
warden, with whom he was a favourite, asked, as he
so often did.
</p>

<p>
"Excellently well," was Herman's answer.
"How go things in the city?"
</p>

<p>
"Doubtful," the warden said almost impatiently,
as if it annoyed him to recall something.  "That
Deacon, Cochlaeus, has worried the Council for days
past, and the Burgomaster has had a troublesome
time because, forsooth, the Churchman declared that
the Englishman, Tyndale, has been hiding within
the walls, but had, in some unaccountable manner,
got away.  And he must needs declare that we
were not alert, else he would never have passed
the gate.  Then he came down on those who have
to keep an eye to the ships, and he blames them
and us alike, thinking to hit the right one with his
random methods."
</p>

<p>
The man stamped out his annoyance on the hard
stones, and Herman felt that if the chief warden
could have his way Cochlaeus would have no
gentle treatment.
</p>

<p>
"Didst say William Tyndale, here, in the city?"
Herman asked, in simulated surprise.  "You mean
that English fellow who, they say, is come to this
country to get his Bible printed?"
</p>

<p>
The men stared at him in equal surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Dost mean to say, Herman, that you do not
know that it has been common talk in the city that
he was hiding somewhere here?  Cochlaeus was
so sure about it, that every printer's shop has been
searched, although he declared his conviction that
the real culprit was Master Byrckmann, who is to be
your father-in-law some day, so they say."
</p>

<p>
The wardens laughed, but Herman put on a look
of supreme contempt for such an absurd charge
against Margaret's father.
</p>

<p>
"I have been away so much of late," he explained.
"And so many things happen in a short time.
Have they found Tyndale?"
</p>

<p>
"That's just where the fun comes in," said the
chief warden, his face, like his underlings', all
smiles.
</p>

<p>
Before he said more, he looked about him in all
directions; then he dropped his voice so low that
the others could scarcely hear him.
</p>

<p>
"The Englishman was here without a doubt.  I
saw him.  So did each of these.  But not one of us
would tell of him, although there was a price on his
head; for who would sell a man to those tormentors?
The poor man lodged somewhere, nobody knows
where, and when night fell he used to come into the
streets for an airing.  But let that pass.  I can tell
you something more."
</p>

<p>
The warden paused to look about him again.
</p>

<p>
"Cochlaeus came back a few hours since, more
like a madman than a reverend father of the Church,
and his face was not pleasant to see.  He had not
passed the gate long before it got to be known that
he had found that Tyndale really was in the city,
and went away in a ship.  He, and the City Guard,
tracked him into Schouts' castle, up the river, and
that saintly minded robber lord was ready to sell the
Englishman for a thousand golden crowns.  And how
do you think the matter was settled?" said the chief
warden, with a chuckle.  "When the bargain was
struck, and they went into the dungeon for Cochlaeus
to claim his purchase, William Tyndale was gone!"
</p>

<p>
"Gone?"
</p>

<p>
Herman's face was the picture of astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to tell me that Tyndale managed
to dupe Schouts, of all men in the world?" he
cried.
</p>

<p>
"I do.  And since I have no love either for the
robber lord, who is a rascal, or the Deacon," said the
chief warden, whispering behind his hand, "I'm glad
the poor man got away.  I hope he'll get clear out
of the country and spoil the plans of the Inquisitor."
</p>

<p>
Herman looked at the man to judge how far he
seemed sincere, but it was impossible to doubt him.
So had he seen others look when Cochlaeus was
spoken of&mdash;a man hated of all men for his work's
sake, to say nothing of his well-known mercilessness.
</p>

<p>
Herman moved on.  He did not know, as he
passed away from the gate, that the chief warden
looked after him commiseratingly, and shrugged his
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"There's trouble in store for that poor fellow,"
he said to the men around.
</p>

<p>
At heart Herman was relieved to find that no
whisper had got abroad that his home had given
shelter to the man whom Cochlaeus was searching
for.  At first he walked along the street with a free
step and a light heart, for he would soon see
Margaret, and explain to her why he had been away
so long.  And to-morrow was the day of their
wedding!  He was home in time!  He whistled
gaily at the thought.
</p>

<p>
But for some unaccountable reason a sense of dread
came to him.  The gaiety passed, and the dread
grew with every step onward, before he had gone far.
The thought came that Margaret would blame him
for neglect, leaving her for so many days without a
word, and her wedding day so near!  And yet he
had sent her a message by a man named Jermyn,
who knew the circumstances, since he worked at
the windmill, telling her he would be home in good
time for their marriage, but he must make sure that
William Tyndale was safe in hiding, and beyond
discovery.  But his content, while on the road, had
been rudely shaken, for when he came to a lonely
spot on the way, he saw a man lying, beaten, and
bruised, and bleeding by the wayside, and it was
Jermyn, his messenger, scarce able to speak.
</p>

<p>
When he had lodged the poor fellow at an inn,
and left money to cover his nursing, he had come on
swiftly, anxious to set the misfortune right.
</p>

<p>
A sense of brooding calamity grew on him while
he walked the familiar streets, but what form it
could take he could not conceive.  It was not that
Margaret would resent his laggard arrival, and
display unreasonable temper&mdash;he knew her too well to
have that thought.  It was a brooding fear of
something infinitely worse than that.  It might be that
ruin had overtaken her father because Cochlaeus had
discovered the part he had played in printing off the
Scripture sheets.  It might be&mdash;&mdash;  God forbid!
</p>

<p>
He stopped, and drops of sweat like great beads
rolled down his face.  His darling might be dead!
</p>

<p>
He had turned down the street which led to his
own home, thinking to see his mother first, and
change his travel-stained clothes for something
better; but this possibility sent him down a byway
which would take him by short-cuts to his darling's
home.
</p>

<p>
He went at first at a swift walk, but this
unnameable horror grew on him so much that he broke
into a run, so that when he came out of the alley
almost opposite Margaret's home he was so spent
and breathless that he had to stand a few minutes
before he could enter the house and was able to speak.
</p>

<p>
When he entered the shop Margaret's father was
standing behind the counter.  The gloom on the
printer's face forced a question from his lips.
</p>

<p>
"What is wrong?  Where is she?  Is she dead?"
</p>

<p>
He stood at the counter, his hands shaking as they
rested on it, his face flushed with the heat of his run,
his lips trembling, and his breath coming almost in
sobs.
</p>

<p>
"I know not," was the slow and sad reply.  "God
knows, Herman, but we do not.  And to-morrow
was to be her marriage day.  Come in, my son, where
we can talk."
</p>

<p>
The printer led the way into the quiet parlour
behind the shop, where Margaret and Herman had
spent so many happy hours.  There Byrckmann
sank into a chair, and, resting his elbows on the table,
buried his careworn face in his hands, and wept.
And to see a strong man weep is like watching a
strong swimmer in his agony in a sea that claims him,
and is seeking to drag him down.
</p>

<p>
"My darling!  My child!  My child!  Would God
I had died for thee!" he sobbed.
</p>

<p>
Herman sat and gazed at him with hungry eyes.
His soul was in a tumult.  He wanted to ask what
this meant, but he dared not, while this storm of
grief was shaking Byrckmann.  But bit by bit, in a
little while the story came, so meagre since
Margaret's father knew so little.  Margaret had never
returned home.  He had gone to Herman's home,
and neither had he come, and his mother could tell
the printer nothing.  She could only express the
wonder whether the girl had sought to find her
way through the cavern, while Herman had gone
forward with Tyndale to see him out of danger, and
she had lost herself in that great, wandering place,
which had once lodged the larger part of an army.
</p>

<p>
Herman's mother and Byrckmann had gone
down to the cavern, and had searched it through
and through, not once, but twice, and even thrice,
thinking that some corner had been left
unexplored.  Strange to say, they found a passage
Herman's mother knew nothing of, but it seemed
to end in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>.  They found a lantern on the
floor, broken and smoked, and a bit of lace.  The
lantern belonged to Herman, and the lace was
Margaret's; but that was all.
</p>

<p>
The printer had gone everywhere he could think
of in the city to look for his daughter, and John
Gropper had gone as well.  He was out now, looking
for her.  So, too, had the workmen left the printing-presses,
which now stood idle, to search, in their love
for her, even down to the boys who served the men;
but it would be the same as before&mdash;the same story
of failure.
</p>

<p>
Herman sat, stupefied.  This was calamity.  It
might mean so much!  It could scarcely mean less
than death.
</p>

<p>
While he walked slowly home he was reeling
as a drunken man, and people, in the darkest part of
the gloaming, looked at him askance.  But they
understood when they saw who it was, since it had
become widely known that the beautiful girl whose
marriage was fixed for to-morrow had disappeared.
Some had whispered the dread words&mdash;"The
Inquisition!"  Byrckmann had it in mind, but did
not say the words.  Nor had the wardens at the
gate spoken of it, although they knew that
Margaret was missing, and feared for the possible
explanation&mdash;the Familiars!
</p>

<p>
"Mother, she's gone!" he cried, as he entered his
home, and, staggering along the passage, stood,
white-faced and shaken, in the doorway, where she
sat, trying to do her usual work.
</p>

<p>
"I know, my son!" she exclaimed, coming to
throw her arms about him to comfort him.  But
how could she do that when the uncertainty was
beginning to vanish, and the thought was crystallising
in her mind that her boy's bride was somewhere
in the Familiars' power?  It had once been said that
over the gate of Hell the inscription was cut deep in
the imperishable granite:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "All hope abandon, ye who enter here."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Was the haunt of the Inquisition a place where
Hope could come any more than in that Hell of
which the poet wrote?  And what was it to them
that Margaret was tender and beautiful and young?
That was no shield to ward off their torture strokes.
</p>

<p>
Herman's mother felt that it was useless to
whisper any words of comfort, for she was borne
down by anxiety, and fearful of the worst.
</p>

<p>
When he had had some food, and had washed
away his travel stains, Herman went through the
cavern, but the quest was an unsuccessful one.  His
exhaustive search brought him to the passage of
which the printer had spoken.  He halted in the
<i>cul-de-sac</i>, with the rock in front of him, and examined
it closely.  All these underground ways and caverns
which were common in that part of the country
might have their arms or, as they seemed to him,
their tentacles; and yet he was convinced that this
was no dead end.
</p>

<p>
Standing in the dim light which his horn lantern
threw on the walls, he tried to think the whole thing
out, and form some plan of action; for if Margaret
was alive he would find her, whether the search
covered days or weeks.
</p>

<p>
He stood with folded arms, the lantern at his
feet; but he bent down for it presently, and scanned
the rock which closed up the end of the passage.
He had thought of the <i>cul-de-sac</i> in the forest cavern,
which the forester had shown him, and which proved
to be an entrance to the castle of the robber lord.
</p>

<p>
Might not this be like that, and leading into some
place where Margaret might be?
</p>

<p>
The thought began to frame itself into something
like a certainty, for when he set the lantern on the
floor again, he noticed that the earth which had
drifted on the rock was beaten in, as though it had
been trampled on by many feet.  He went on his
knees and saw some footprints&mdash;those of men who
were not shod as he was.  His boots were nailed,
but these marks were not from them.
</p>

<p>
Presently his eyes, in that keen search, caught
the gleam of something like gold, and when he
took it into his hand and held it to the lantern light
he exclaimed in wonder.  This was his darling's
golden bracelet, which he had given her on the day
of their betrothal, and he wondered how it came
here.  Thrusting it safely into his pocket, he sat
back on his heels and thought.  Was this not a
<i>cul-de-sac</i> after all, but the entrance to some
house?
</p>

<p>
He endeavoured to locate the spot.  Hard by, just
over the cavern, was the city wall.  He knew of
the houses that were there, but this passage,
which was long and narrow, running inwards
beneath the city&mdash;where did it lie?  It ran level
with the city wall at first, but then it took a turn,
and at right angles it stretched along for many
yards.
</p>

<p>
For a time he merely groped, as it were, in his
mind.  It was difficult to get his bearings as to
streets and houses, but after a while the thing
assumed such shape that a cry came from his lips,
and his heart so throbbed with pain that his hand
went to it to still it.
</p>

<p>
"The Holy House!" he exclaimed.  "My darling
is there!"
</p>

<p>
He went over it all in his mind again, and knew
it must be so, and then he saw what had happened.
The picture was vividly portrayed, and his imagination
served him so well that he could see men's
faces, their doings, and his darling's horror.
Margaret had gone into the cavern when he left her,
and had fallen into the hands of the Familiars, who
had walked down this passage and in some way
through this place which was blocked by an
apparently impassable wall of rock.  And she was
taken into that place of terror&mdash;that den of infamy.
It must be so, for there were those dull footprints,
such as Familiars would leave, and her bracelet to
show that she had been there.  And every footprint
pointed to the rock.  None turned away from it,
to suggest that they had found her here and carried
her away.
</p>

<p>
His blood began to boil at the thought of Margaret's
jeopardy.  His memory was alive to all the deeds
of cruelty he had heard of, and his hands clenched
tightly, while he began to think of vengeance.  His
fingers went to his belt, and, drawing the dagger
from its sheath, he gazed at it, and vowed that if
those men had hurt his darling, or stood between
her and her liberty, the steel should be reddened with
the blood of her tormentors.
</p>

<p>
He sprang to his feet, caught up the lantern, and
tested the rock as he and Engel had done when
they entered the castle in the forest to search for
William Tyndale.  He scanned it thoroughly, but for
a long time saw no trace of any opening.  At last
he observed what looked like a crack, and drawing
the dagger from his belt again he thrust the point
at it.  The thin, keen-edged blade went in some
little distance, and he moved it upwards.  It ran
up and up, till it would go no farther.  He turned
the blade, and ran it from right to left for the space
of a couple of feet.  Then down the left side the
dagger moved.  At the bottom the blade travelled
easily towards the right.
</p>

<p>
That was proof that there was an opening in
the rock, and he believed that the rock would
move.  But how?  Was there a spring anywhere
that must be touched before it would shift inwards
and towards him?  He began to search for it.
With the lantern's aid he scanned the surface,
inch after inch, intent on finding this spring, for he
meant to get in, taking the tremendous risks, to
look for his darling and bring her away, if he could
find her, whatever the cost.
</p>

<p>
Nearly an hour went, and although he began to
despair he could not bring himself to give up the
attempt.  Margaret must have been carried through
that space which was nearly four feet high, and he,
too, would go and bring her from the Holy House,
even if he had to fight his way inch by inch.  What
could frustrate him when his dear one was there?
</p>

<p>
When the quest for the secret spring appeared
so hopeless that he began to think the discovery
was impossible, his finger, which travelled over the
face of the rock near by this door very delicately,
marked something unlike what was near it.  He
pressed the spot, and to his wonder and relief, and
yet almost to his alarm, because of what might
follow, the door moved slowly back to the left, and
there was an open space before him.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
IN THE LION'S MOUTH
</h3>

<p>
For a little while Herman's courage failed
him.  To ascend those steps which he
could see would probably mean such fearful
experiences that the bravest of the brave
might shrink back and leave his task undone.
</p>

<p>
Yet now that he had such unquestionable proof
that Margaret had been at this door, and as certainly
had entered it in the company of the black-robed
ones of the Inquisition, how could he think other
than that she was lying in one of the cells, if not
already enduring torture?  Loving her as he did,
he could not be so craven as to turn away and leave
her in the hands of the tormentors!
</p>

<p>
The bare suggestion in his mind that she might
possibly have been done to death made his soul
stand up in arms, and his hesitation was gone in an
instant.  He ascended the steps without halting
until he came to the topmost one and found himself
looking along a passage with doors on either side.
</p>

<p>
Were they the doors of cells, such as he had heard
spoken of so often in the city, when men and women
talked with bated breath of the horrors of the
Holy House?  And if they were, was Margaret in
one of them?
</p>

<p>
The nearest door, when he ventured so far, opened
as he pressed his hand against it.  Looking in, he
found the cell empty.  It was the same with the
next, the third, and the fourth, for he tried each
door on either side.  All were empty, but the straw
lay on the floors, and the rats scrambled away
when he entered.  They had come to these dismal
places to root among the straw for any crusts that
might have been left by the prisoners who last
occupied the cells.
</p>

<p>
Every place in the passage was unoccupied, and
Herman ventured up twenty more steps to find
himself in some open ground&mdash;a great garden
bounded by some very high walls.  He was so near
to one of them that by the aid of the moon he could
see the iron spikes which rendered escape impossible
if any poor prisoner made the attempt.
</p>

<p>
He was in the greatest quandary now, for, looking
along the garden, the immensity of the place set
him wondering how he could possibly find Margaret.
Some sixty yards away, beyond the grass and
bushes, was the main building, and his darling
must be there; but in which part?  And how was
he to enter unseen?  If he passed along the passage
at the top of this last flight of steps, what could he
do?  The cells that were occupied would be bolted
and barred, and there was nothing to indicate the
name of the victim on the other side of those strong,
iron-sheeted doors.
</p>

<p>
He was dismayed with the thought of the hopelessness
of it all.
</p>

<p>
Standing beneath a tree whose heavy branches
hung round him like a tent, with an opening here
and there, he watched the scene, trying to solve
the problem of finding his darling.  The first thing
was to make a bolder endeavour yet&mdash;going into
the very heart of the danger&mdash;to see where the
Familiars had placed her.  When that was done
he must get into touch with her; and once with
Margaret, none of those who kept that fearful
house should hinder him from taking her away.
And surely God would help him!
</p>

<p>
The moon was brilliant.  She was sailing at her
full across a cloudless sky, throwing deep shadows
everywhere, but lighting up the open spaces like
day.  If anyone crossed the green expanse of
grass he would know who it was if he ventured
with uncovered face in the fine silvery light.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis no use standing here," he muttered.  "I
must take the risks.  She must be found."
</p>

<p>
He went forward while he spoke, and, entering by
the doorway through which he had come a few
minutes before, he moved on down the passage,
trying the doors.  Like all the others, they were
empty, and the bitter thought came that those
who had last lodged there had paid the death penalty
for their heresy, and the Familiars were in the city
on the quest for others to take their places.
Otherwise, would it be likely that he could come so far
and find no one who could challenge his presence?
</p>

<p>
He came to a door like all the others&mdash;iron-sheeted,
with bolts and bars on the outside and a
key in the lock.  He pressed against the door with
his hand, but while the bars were leaning against
the stonework, and the bolts were not thrust into
their sockets, the door did not move.
</p>

<p>
"She may be here," he muttered, and his heart
beat more quickly at the thought.  He twisted the
key, and the door opened and he passed in.
</p>

<p>
He was not sure, but he thought he heard a sound,
but that might be the prisoner moving on the straw.
As he stood within the dark cell, he spoke.
"Is anyone here?"
</p>

<p>
There was no answer to the question, and he went
farther in, holding out his lantern to scan the place
with its aid.  The straw was there, but no one on it.
His foot kicked against a water-jar, and he heard the
splash of the water, and saw it gleam as it scattered
on the horrid floor.  A rat was not far away, trying
to carry with him in his flight a piece of black bread;
but, look where he would, there was no other sign of
life.  Certainly nothing human was there.
</p>

<p>
He turned away, in disappointment, but, looking
up, he started, and the lantern almost fell from his
hand in the extremity of his alarm.  Two Familiars
were between him and the door, one carrying a
lantern, the other closing the door as though to
shut themselves and this intruder in.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you? and what are you doing here?"
the nearer one asked, in a sharp and angry tone.
"How dare you intrude like this?"
</p>

<p>
Herman made no answer, and the instinct of
caution made him use his free hand to draw his cap
low down to his eyebrows, to hide himself as much as
possible.  He had a thought of what might follow
if he got away, and these men should recognise him.
And while doing this, and staring at these men, he
was wondering what he should do next&mdash;how he
should get away.
</p>

<p>
"Answer my questions!" came the demand imperatively.
</p>

<p>
"I'll answer no questions!" cried Herman, his
courage rising; and he was resolute to stand at
nothing rather than be held a prisoner, to be at the
mercy of these creatures who were facing him.
He thought, and quickly, that he would make a
sudden rush.  He would dash his lantern in the
cowled face of one of them, and then with his
doubled fist strike out at both, in the hope, by
taking them unawares, to throw them, and pass
through the doorway.
</p>

<p>
He was in the act of throwing his hand back to
hurl the lantern, but the others were on him, and one
long, lean hand was feeling for his throat.  Against
such odds he dropped the lantern to be free.  He
gripped the wrist that was near his throat, and with
the free hand he dashed his fist in the face of the
other, who staggered back with a cry of pain.
</p>

<p>
But there was more to be done.  He gave the
wrist which he was gripping a twist which seemed to
crack, and a scream of agony followed.  But still the
men pressed on him.  Herman dropped the maimed
hand so that his own two might be free; and because
he fought as one who knew that defeat meant torture
and death, his fists came with double weight until
those who sought to overwhelm him put up their
hands to ward off his quick and terrific blows from
their faces.  He gave them neither time nor mercy.
</p>

<p>
One of them, in a frenzy of anger, leapt at him, but
Herman met him with a blow which sent him
staggering backwards.  He caught his heels in his
black robe, and fell with a crash against the wall;
then tumbled in a huddled and senseless mass to the
floor.  The sight of this added to the other's fury,
and he, too, came at Herman, clawing with his
fingers as if to tear at his face and eyes, but Herman,
bending, took him at the waist, and in the full heat
of this combat lifted him bodily and threw him
over his head, as he had seen the wrestlers do in
the city sports.  The Familiar seemed, as Herman
staggered with the effort, to hurtle through the air;
his head crashed against the wall, and without a
groan or cry, he fell, like the other, and lay still.
</p>

<p>
It was no time to see what had come to these who
sought to overwhelm him.  He knew that if he
lingered he might have still greater odds to contend
with, and escape would be impossible.  The way to
the door was clear, and he hurried to it, and, opening
it, stood in the passage.  Then the thought came to
elude pursuit, supposing either of these two minions
of the Holy House should recover and give the
alarm.  He closed the door swiftly, but softly.  He
twisted the key in the lock, and drew it away; and,
carrying it in his hand, he strode to the door where,
not long before, he had entered from the garden.
</p>

<p>
Out in the open he would be safer than within the
house itself, and, hidden somewhere in the shadows
among the dense bushes, he might think of some
plan to scale the walls and get away.  With the key
still in his hand, he went to the tree where he had
stood before to make his observations; and while he
was trying to solve the problem of his next course
he was startled.  A bush, like laurels or
rhododendrons, towards which he began to move to be in
safer hiding, parted, and a face appeared, and then
Herman saw the rough hair and straggling beard of
a man.
</p>

<p>
The moon fell full on the face, and Herman knew
it; but he kept still and silent for a few moments,
listening for some possible alarm in the Holy House;
but everything was silent.  There was no clamour
of voices to break the stillness of the night, no sound
of men beating on the locked door to arouse
attention.
</p>

<p>
Precious though the moments were, he watched
the bearded face.  The man's eyes were turned to
the building, and his hands held back the bush on
either side of him, so that his view should not be
obscured.  In a little while he came part way out
into the open, and Herman saw, by the man's full
body, that he was not mistaken as to his identity.
</p>

<p>
"Heinrich!" he exclaimed, just so loud that his
voice travelled over the intervening space.
</p>

<p>
The man was alarmed, dropped back into the
shadow of the bush, and was lost sight of completely.
</p>

<p>
Silence followed, and Herman listened as intently
as before for any sound of alarm in the cell; but
none came.  He broke the silence, for here was
someone who might be of service.
</p>

<p>
"Heinrich, don't you know my voice?"
</p>

<p>
The face reappeared, and Herman saw how it
turned towards the tree where he was standing
unseen.  He was struck partly with its terror,
partly with its cunning.
</p>

<p>
"Is it Herman Bengel?" came the question.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I will come to you, for I want your help."
</p>

<p>
Herman was still speaking, when the man crossed
to the tree with swift strides.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, so that I may know where you are,"
Heinrich whispered.  "Nay, come here, where the
moonlight is, and I may see your face; or how shall
I know that you are not one of those murderous
hounds of that house yonder, trying to get your
sharp fangs into me?"
</p>

<p>
Herman stepped out into the moonlight, and the
other, who watched him, caught at Herman's hand
and kissed it.
</p>

<p>
"God has sent you!" he exclaimed, below his
breath, lest anyone might hear beyond themselves.
"Come with me, and I will show you what will do
your heart good!  Ay, and it will gladden your
eyes."
</p>

<p>
Herman wondered what his meaning was, but he
told him why he was here in the garden, and how
anxious he was to get away because of that struggle
in the cell.
</p>

<p>
"You really did all that?" exclaimed Heinrich,
and, precious though the moments were, he danced
right out in the moonlight for the joy of the thing.
In the extremity of his jubilation his eyes were full
of tears, and Herman looked on in wonder, and
part, too, in dread, lest the poor, simple fellow had
gone from imbecility to madness.
</p>

<p>
"Give me the key," Heinrich implored.  "The
day may come when I may use it and set some poor
prisoner free."  He put forth his hand for it, and
Herman, having no need for it, gave it to him.
</p>

<p>
"But she is there, I feel assured, Heinrich, in
that horrible place," said Herman anxiously.
"And now I am helpless.  I dare not go back for
her."
</p>

<p>
"You need not!"  Heinrich broke in on his
words impulsively.  "You need not.  Go on your
knees and thank God!  Say what I heard Mistress
Margaret say, 'Bless the Lord, O my soul!'  Say
it, for she is not there, in that accursed house.
She was, but she is not now.  She is safe.  I
got her away from the tormentors.  Listen to me."
</p>

<p>
Heinrich dropped his voice to a whisper, and had
put his arm about Herman's neck, to speak in his
ear.
</p>

<p>
"I have her in safe keeping, hidden where none
of those Familiars can find her," he said exultingly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean it?" whispered Herman, trembling
at what he heard.  "Is she not in that house
yonder?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  She was there.  She was to be taken to
the torture chamber, but I took her away, and I
have her now in safe keeping, thank God!  Listen
again.  She mourned, in spite of her gladness at
being free, because she had lost a bracelet which
you gave her on her betrothal day.  I have come
to find it.  I am going to the cell from whence I
brought her to look for it, and when I have found
it I will take you to her."
</p>

<p>
Herman was elate with gladness, and his lips
were quietly muttering his grateful thanks for
God's deliverance of his darling.
</p>

<p>
"There is no need to seek for it, Heinrich.  I
have found the bracelet.  It was that which made
me confident that she had been taken to the Holy
House.  See, it is here!"
</p>

<p>
Holding back one of the drooping branches,
Herman held it where the gold gleamed in the
moonlight, and the jewels in it glanced in their
many-coloured splendour.
</p>

<p>
"That is it, Heinrich.  Will you take it and me
to her?"
</p>

<p>
"I will!" the simple one exclaimed.  "Let me
carry it.  She will then know that I redeemed my
promise."  He took the bracelet from Herman's
hand, and kissed it.
</p>

<p>
Herman listened for any possible sound in the
cell, but everything was silent.  Even the night-birds
made no sound to-night, and the trees scarcely
moved, so that there was but little rustling among
the leaves.  He was relieved, for there was no alarm
as yet, and they might get away.
</p>

<p>
"Time is precious, Heinrich," he said.  "Those
men may call for help."
</p>

<p>
"I do not hear them," said Heinrich simply.
"But let us go.  How glad she will be! to have
this&mdash;and you!" He moved away while he was
speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we going?" Herman asked, when
they stepped into the shelter of a bush after crossing
a wide and moonlit lawn.
</p>

<p>
"To the wall.  Can you climb it?"
</p>

<p>
A daring thought, since the silence was unbroken,
came to Herman.  It was next door to madness,
but he yielded to it.
</p>

<p>
"I will take you by the way I came, Heinrich,
and then you shall see how I came to feel so certain
that Mistress Margaret had been taken to the Holy
House."
</p>

<p>
"My way is best," said Heinrich doubtfully.
"And it is safest."
</p>

<p>
"But 'tis worth trying.  Besides, I have this,
and if any try to bar the way, we'll use it;" and
from his belt he drew the dagger which he had
forgotten in that struggle in the cell.
</p>

<p>
"I, too, have one," cried Heinrich, drawing his
own weapon; and then from caution he went on
to the same readiness for recklessness which
Herman was displaying.
</p>

<p>
They went carefully, to avoid being seen, in case
any who dwelt in the place should be moving about
the garden, or any eyes should be searching the
moonlit grounds from the windows.  The silence
had emboldened Herman to this real madness, and
he went forward to the door, alert and ready to
strike a blow if anyone strove to bar the
way.
</p>

<p>
They stepped in at the doorway and listened, but
all was silent; not even a groan from that cell where
Herman had left the Familiars.  He saw what he
had not seen before&mdash;a lighted lantern on the floor
at one of the doors.  It was not there when he had
first gone to the cell, so that his thought was that
one of the Familiars had left it there before entering
the place where they found him.
</p>

<p>
"We'll take that with us, Heinrich," he whispered.
"Mine is locked up in the cell."
</p>

<p>
Going swiftly down the steps, always ready if
anyone approached, and past the open cells, they
came to the opening in the rock, Heinrich's eyes
moving in all directions to miss nothing.  Herman
watched him, and the thought came that he was
projecting his mind to future days when he might
use this passage and come to set some poor captive
free, since it was his boasted delight to spoil the
plans of the masters of the Holy House.
</p>

<p>
Heinrich watched with growing wonder how the
rock door swung back noiselessly into its place
after they had passed into the cavern, leaving no
token of any opening.
</p>

<p>
"Show me how you opened it!" he exclaimed.
"I may find my way in some day, and get someone
out of this."
</p>

<p>
"You shall see," Herman answered, falling in
with his desire.  "Look at that spot there, where
the rock by the door has scaled off ever so slightly."
</p>

<p>
"Here?" asked Heinrich, touching it with his
finger.
</p>

<p>
Herman nodded.  "Press hard."
</p>

<p>
Heinrich tried it again and again, watching with
eager interest how the door moved back and forth
at his will.  Then the bearded face lit up with
childish glee.
</p>

<p>
"I have been here before!" he exclaimed, looking
round the place.  "It was here that I saw them
with Mistress Margaret.  Yes, it was here.  I shall
often come here, and won't I spoil the Egyptians!"
</p>

<p>
He hugged himself at the thought, and was
exultant while Herman led him to the cave's
entrance, where they saw the great river rolling by
in solemn silence, but shining under the moon's
still rays.  Heinrich gazed in all directions, and,
rubbing his hands, he whispered, as though the bush
had listeners in it:
</p>

<p>
"I know!  I came into the cavern by this
entrance.  Yonder I shall find the gate.  Away in
that direction is the Burgomaster's house.  Oh
yes, I know!  But let me be sure.  There is this
bush and that gleaming bit of rock, like a dog's
head.  Yes, 'tis the same.  And to think of the
dismay of the black Familiars when they come
from time to time and find one of the cells
empty! this one to-day, and that one to-morrow!"
</p>

<p>
He stopped, with a puzzled look on his face.
</p>

<p>
"I want to take you to Mistress Margaret, but
I cannot.  We are outside the city walls, and we
may not go in again till dawn of day, when the
gates are opened.  Let us go back to that accursed
house, and into the garden, and climb the wall."
</p>

<p>
Herman smiled as he watched Heinrich's anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"There is no need.  I am going to take you by
a private way if you will give me your solemn
promise never to betray it to anyone."
</p>

<p>
The other looked at him reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"How could you think I would do so base a
thing?" he cried.  "I, who love so much those
who have been kind to me?  How could you even
think of it?"
</p>

<p>
Taking Herman's hand, Heinrich gazed into his
eyes still more, and presently a tear fell down the
poor fellow's face, and yet another, and many more.
</p>

<p>
"How could you think it?" he exclaimed
again, protestingly.
</p>

<p>
"Dry up your tears, Heinrich!" Herman
exclaimed hastily.  "I never doubted you.  I only
wanted you to know the consequences of a careless
word, for it might mean death to one or many of
your friends."
</p>

<p>
"And you can trust me?"
</p>

<p>
"As much as I can trust myself," Herman
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Then I am content.  Come!  Let us be going,
for Mistress Margaret will be anxious since I have
been so long away."
</p>

<p>
Before many minutes had gone they had passed
through the doorway of rock which the eagle eyes
of the keenest of the Familiars would never have
suspected as an entrance, then through Tyndale's
room and up the secret stairs into Herman's home.
His mother heard him coming, and then the story,
just where they met, was told.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go and tell Margaret's father!" Herman's
mother exclaimed, her eyes gleaming with gladness;
and although it was night, and the streets were
dangerous for a woman to venture out, the thought
of a father's and a sick mother's inexpressible
anxiety, more painful because of her sense of
helplessness, induced her to undertake the errand.
</p>

<p>
They kept each other company up to the point
where they were compelled to part.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Mistress Margaret?" Herman asked,
when he and Heinrich, watching his mother disappear
at the bend of a street, turned into an alley.
</p>

<p>
"That's my secret," came the laughing answer.
"Come and see."
</p>

<p>
They took all the byways, until Herman was completely
lost, and then, unexpectedly, he was pulled
up in front of a stable door, which Heinrich opened.
</p>

<p>
"Go in!" the simple one exclaimed, standing
aside; "but wait," he added, when Herman stood
within, not knowing where to move in the darkness.
After some trouble, Heinrich lit his lantern and led
the way up some rickety steps into a hayloft.
</p>

<p>
Standing on the top step, Herman saw a humble
room where the furniture was scarce and poor.
A table stood in the middle of the floor, and by it
sat an elderly woman, working at a man's much worn
garment by the candlelight, although the hour was
so late.  She looked up when she heard Heinrich's
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," he whispered, looking in through the
half-opened door almost stealthily.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my son."
</p>

<p>
"Is she asleep?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  She was talking to me, anxious about you,
until she heard you down below, and then she went
to her room to be out of the way.  But I heard
someone else.  Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Go and tell her, mother, to come and see her
lover, the man she should have wedded to-morrow.
Tell her that, mother."
</p>

<p>
Herman gazed around the bare and desolate
place when he had stepped within.  A few moments
only had gone when a cry sprang to his lips.  For
through the open doorway which Heinrich's mother
had passed, someone came.  It was Margaret, her
hands outstretched, her beautiful face wan and
pale, transformed now from the consuming anxiety
before the woman entered.  Her eyes were gleaming
with the love-light.
</p>

<p>
"Herman!" she cried, as she went to her lover's
arms.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
THE GREAT ALTERNATIVE
</h3>

<p>
Margaret was still in jeopardy, and before
many hours had gone it was known that
she stood in danger of again being lodged
in the place from whence she had just
been rescued.  What should have been her bridal day
was spent in hiding, and her father did not dare to
come to see her in the broad daylight lest someone
belonging to the Holy House should be watching, in
readiness to track him, on the supposition that he
would be going to see his daughter.
</p>

<p>
It was dark when he came, but after he had gone
home again, Margaret pleaded to be taken home, if
only for an hour, to see her mother.
</p>

<p>
"No!" cried Heinrich, who had come back to
the stable, pale and dishevelled, the water dripping
from him as he stood within the room.  "No! something
will happen.  You will run into the arms of
those fiends who are seeking for you, and I have been
told that they have sworn to find you, and break
you on the rack, and after that to burn you in the
Holy House garden, into which all who are confined
there are to be brought to witness your sufferings."
</p>

<p>
Margaret shuddered, and hid her face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Who told you all that?" Herman asked, pale
and trembling at the threat, but realising, from
what was common knowledge, that what the
simple-minded man said was more than likely to be true.
It was the thing one could have expected.
</p>

<p>
"I will not tell you," Heinrich answered, almost
curtly.  "Why should I?  And yet, why not?"
he added quickly, wiping his face with his kerchief,
for it was streaming with the rain which could be
heard pattering heavily on the roof.  Before he said
more, he looked round the room, and, uncertain
about the door, went to it, and, standing on the top,
called down softly to his mother, who was below:
</p>

<p>
"Is the outer door locked?"
</p>

<p>
The whispered question was answered softly,
when, from the sounds that followed, they who
listened knew that she had gone to the door to try it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my son."
</p>

<p>
"You are sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Certain."
</p>

<p>
Heinrich turned to the others with a look of
relief.
</p>

<p>
"Now I will tell you.  This afternoon I stood
at the ferry, keeping well out of sight to see what
the Burgomaster was doing there.  Something had
gone wrong, and he was directing some men who
were working at the posts which take the chains
that stretch across the water-gate.  Some of the
men, who were standing waist-deep in the water,
crossed themselves, and it was easy to see that they
shrank from something.  I bent forward to see what
they were looking at, and there I saw them&mdash;two of
those hungry vultures&mdash;walking noiselessly, side by
side.  When they had looked around, as if to
mark whether they were observed, they disappeared
among the bushes which hide the entrance to the
cavern."
</p>

<p>
"What then?" Margaret half whispered, leaning
forward in her chair, her lips white and parted, and
her fingers on them, trembling.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-244"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-244.jpg" alt="&quot;HALT!&quot; CAME THE CRY ON THE NIGHT AIR. <i>See page 214.</i>">
<br>
&quot;HALT!&quot; CAME THE CRY ON THE NIGHT AIR. <i><a href="#p214">See page 214.</a></i>
</p>

<p>
"I followed them, and stole along until I, too,
came to the bushes.  They were gone into the
cavern then, but I went also, and followed until I
saw them, by the light of their lantern, going to the
passage which leads into the Holy House.  They
thought themselves alone, and talked freely to two
others who had just come out of the Holy House,
going, no doubt, on some nefarious errand.
</p>

<p>
"It was then, as I stood back in hiding, but
craning forward not to miss a word or any movement,
that I heard all.  Those who were returning said
that they had scoured the city, but found no trace
of the missing girl.  What next they said made
me shiver in my boots.  It was hard to keep my
teeth from chattering, which I feared they would
have heard.  The two who came through the doorway
said their orders were, at eleven o'clock to-night,
when the people of the city would be asleep,
to go to Master Byrckmann's house and search it,
high and low, and if they found you not, to bring
your father and your mother.
</p>

<p>
"So now, you know!" the simple one exclaimed,
sitting on the floor in his soddened clothes.
</p>

<p>
A low cry came from the girl's lips, and she stood
facing the door, with her hands clenched tightly,
watching with startled eyes as though she expected
to see those sombre and relentless hunters in the
doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Herman, I must go and warn my father.  They
will kill him, and my mother!" she exclaimed, in a
broken voice.  "And rather than that, oh, I would
die!"
</p>

<p>
"No, darling, that must not be," said Herman,
trying to soothe her, and throwing an arm around
her, to give her an assurance of her safety because
of his strength.  "I must take you away from the
city at once.  We must get you to my mother's
house, and away through the cavern to the river;
and after that God will tell us what to do," he said,
in quiet confidence.
</p>

<p>
"Herman, I could not do that.  They would take
my father and mother away because I was not to be
found.  Rather than that, I would give myself up."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, that you shall never do!" Herman
cried, holding the girl more closely to him.  "Listen.
Heinrich shall think out some way of escape for us
all, and while he is doing that I will go to your
father and bid him and your mother come here, and
we can all go to some safe place out of the reach of
those who want to find you."
</p>

<p>
"You are safe for a time!" exclaimed Heinrich,
who had risen to his feet and was standing before
Margaret with hands that played with the weapon
at his belt.
</p>

<p>
"Safe, Heinrich?" Margaret asked.  "But not
for long," raising her startled eyes to his, as though
she would read in them the extent of her security.
"'Tis my father I am thinking of, and my mother,"
she cried, in a broken voice.
</p>

<p>
"Let me think!" exclaimed Heinrich, throwing
out his hand.  "I am bewildered.  Give me time,
for it is a long while yet till the cathedral bell strikes
out the hour of eleven."
</p>

<p>
Wet though he was, his soaking clothes clinging
to his thin body, and the water still trickling down
his face from his soddened cap, he sat on the hearth
in a huddled heap, and the others stood by and
watched him in silence.  They thought he had fallen
asleep, he sat so still, and Margaret softly sank
into her chair to wait, while Herman's arm rested
about her shoulder, to reassure her.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to awake unexpectedly, and, springing
to his feet, went to Herman and laid a hand on his
arm.
</p>

<p>
"Go and tell Master Byrckmann what I have told
you.  Make him believe it, for every word I have
spoken is true; otherwise he may bar his door
to-night and refuse to hear the summons.  Tell him
more; to come here with his wife and whatever
money he may have, for it is time to be gone.  Tell
him it is his last chance, and it is death to remain.
It is as ill for him to remain as it was for those who
remained in Sodom when the angels said to Lot,
'Up, get you out of this place.'  Tell him I know
how to get you all out of the city, and you can go
into safety, away from those creatures who are bent
on your destruction."
</p>

<p>
They looked at him in wonder.  It seemed to
them as though he was no longer the simple one of
the city, but some inspired one with a message;
and Herman, when Heinrich had ended, and had
sunk down again to the hearth, worn and tired, took
him at his word.  He kissed Margaret, and, wrapping
his cloak about him, went down the stairs and
out into the driving wind and rain.  He knew the
way, dark though it was, and after traversing the
empty streets, stepped abruptly into the parlour
where Margaret's father was sitting.
</p>

<p>
"What news, Herman?" he asked, when he saw
the young man's face; and while the story came,
of the peril which threatened him and his house,
the printer listened with his head bowed low and
his hands tightly clasped.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis what I suspected, Herman," he said quietly,
when all was told, "and Gropper and I have been
talking of the possibilities.  He may have passed
you in the street, for he has been gone only a few
minutes.  Didst meet him?"
</p>

<p>
Herman shook his head, and his own question came:
</p>

<p>
"What is your plan?"
</p>

<p>
"To get out of the city.  I have lodged much of
my money in the bank, and the banker, who is as
a brother to me, will contrive to send it on to me,
when I let him know where I am gone.  And as for
Gropper, he takes up the business.  He has the
contract hidden away in his bosom at this moment,
and he will pay as God prospers him.  We thought
of starting in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"That will be too late," Herman urged.
</p>

<p>
"I know it now, and since I have told my wife
what lies before us, she was willing, and is like me,
like you, my son, and like our darling&mdash;we are all
in God's hands.  We will start to-night.  I will go
upstairs and bid my dear one get ready."
</p>

<p>
When he came back, Herman watched, and saw
that he had brushed away some tears from his face.
He did not speak, but, taking two strong leathern
wallets from the wall, he went to the strong box in the
corner of the room, and, unlocking it, drew forth a
heavy bag and set it on the table.  The chink of
gold sounded as it touched the board.
</p>

<p>
"Herman," he said quietly, "this was set apart
for Margaret&mdash;her bridal gift.  I give it over to you
for her.  Use that wallet, for its safe keeping."
</p>

<p>
He returned to the box and brought two more
bags, bulky and heavy like that at which Herman
was staring in speechless wonder.  Bringing them
to the table, he placed them in the capacious wallet,
which bulged with its burden, and then, while
Herman followed his example, he flung it over his
shoulder, and drew over it and himself his heavy
cloak.
</p>

<p>
"God has been very good, my son," he said softly.
"He is not sending us forth scripless and moneyless.
Here is ample for our needs, even if it should prove
our all, and I am thankful."
</p>

<p>
He fell on his knees at the table, and bent his
head between his hands in prayer, and while he
knelt someone stole into the room, ready cloaked,
but pale, and went down by his side and put her
arm about him.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go forth, dear heart," she said.  "I long
to see my child, and wherever God sends us, it is
well."
</p>

<p>
The moments were very few before they stood
in the doorway looking into the dark street.  Almost
like thieves in the night, when they had pulled the
door after them and heard the latch fall quietly,
they stole across the street into the dark alley,
the mother with a man on either side of her.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
THE COMING OF THE FORESTER
</h3>

<p>
"Heinrich, take Master and Mistress Byrckmann
to their daughter, and wait till I
return," said Herman, when he stood at
the stable door with Margaret's father and
mother.  "I am going to tell my mother what we
think of doing, unless your plan will let you come
with me to my mother's house, where we can use
that secret way."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, 'twill not do," said Heinrich hastily.
"We might walk straight into the arms of those
whom we want to avoid.  No, my way is best."
</p>

<p>
He spoke so certainly that Herman had no
doubt, since he had often proved the simple one's
resourcefulness.
</p>

<p>
"You will wait for me?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I will.  We cannot start for an hour or two,"
was the ready answer; and Herman turned away,
and ran along the streets swiftly, not to lose
time.
</p>

<p>
He found his mother waiting in great anxiety,
wondering where he was and what had detained
him so long, and he told her in the fewest words of
the plan for flight.
</p>

<p>
While he was busy, putting on fresh clothing
and making ready for his journey, a loud knock on
the street door startled them both.  Herman's
mother answered the summons, and, opening the
door, stared at a man who stood at the bottom step
with the rain streaming from his clothes.
</p>

<p>
"Your business&mdash;what is it?" she asked, with
what courage she could muster, for this stranger's
appearance at such a juncture shook her nerve, and
she imagined that he had come to spy out something.
</p>

<p>
"I want your son, if you be his mother!" the man
exclaimed, loudly enough for any who might be
passing; but he added in a whisper, "Tell him I
am Otto Engel, and I have news for him."
</p>

<p>
"Come in," she answered carelessly, for the
benefit of a man who was passing, and who, for aught
she knew, might be a spy.  She drew back to make
room for the big man to enter the narrow passage.
</p>

<p>
Closing the door the moment he had gone past
her, she led him to the room, and then called up the
stairs warily, as though the walls had ears:
</p>

<p>
"My son, 'tis the forest ranger."
</p>

<p>
Herman had already heard the strong voice, and
he was at the bottom step while his mother was
speaking.
</p>

<p>
"What news?" he asked, when the two men had
clasped hands warmly.
</p>

<p>
"All's well, Herman.  The Englishman is still
in the hut in the mere, and busy with Roye on that
great task of his; but he is restless, and his appetite
is whetted because Roye has got to know that the
printed sheets that were on board the <i>Marburg</i>
are waiting in the hold of the ship that lies at the
quay in Worms, and the captain wants to know
what to do with them.  I'll tell you more.  They
say that the powers that be have at last plucked
up their courage, and declare that this scandal shall
be ended, so that Schouts' castle is to be stormed,
and the robber noble is to be hanged over his own
gate."
</p>

<p>
"If they can get at him!" exclaimed Herman,
with a laugh of incredulity.
</p>

<p>
"That's how things stand," said the forester,
shrugging his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"What has all this to do with me?" Herman
asked after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Everything.  Raymart, whom my father allowed
to stay in the house where Master Tyndale is staying,
has been prowling about in the forest, and a bear
has mauled him so badly that he is ill; so that he
cannot take the good man on to Worms.  And I
do not know the way.  That's why I'm here&mdash;to
get you to go, since you know every inch when once
I put you in the forest."
</p>

<p>
Herman's heart leapt.  It seemed now that the
way for William Tyndale was marked out; and
was it not safety for Margaret also?  Once in Worms,
where the lord of the place was one who would have
no Inquisitors prowling in his streets, and, Pope or
none at all, would hang them with short shrift if
he laid hands on them&mdash;was not that the place to
which Margaret and her dear ones might go?  And
Martin Luther, please God, might marry him and
her!
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Otto, while I am putting some things
together, and I will tell you something," Herman
said, and in the bedroom, after the two men had
tramped up the stairs, Otto listened to the story of
the contemplated flight from the city.
</p>

<p>
"God's hand is in this," the forester said, when
Herman had told him all.  "If that simple lad
will let me join you, I can get you all to a place
where I can hire horses, and we will ride to my
father's mill, and on to William Tyndale.  Then
we can make our other plans; but this is the
pressing thing just now&mdash;to get that dear girl and
her loved ones away from the city.  Shall I come?"
</p>

<p>
Herman looked at the ranger's giant frame, and
his heart leapt at the thought of his help.
</p>

<p>
"It will be splendid," he cried.  "Shall we go
to Heinrich's stable now?  I am ready, if mother
has some warm wrappings for Margaret."
</p>

<p>
"They are here, my son," the woman said,
pointing to a heap of things on the couch downstairs
when they were all standing in the room which
seemed small with two such men in it.  "I will
wrap them in a bundle, and you must be gone."
</p>

<p>
She threw her arms about Herman's neck presently,
kissed him passionately, and told him how she
would spend the night in prayer for their good
speeding.
</p>

<p>
"Wilt come to me some early day, Otto Engel,
and tell me how they fared?" she asked, standing
with her hand on the lock before she opened the
street door.
</p>

<p>
"With all my heart," the forester answered, and
then the two men went into the street, where, as
they faced the sweeping rain and wind, they
staggered and fought hard to keep their feet.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
THE PURCHASE OF THE VAULT
</h3>

<p>
"Who is this?" Heinrich asked
suspiciously, and pointing to Engel, who
stepped into the stable after Herman,
and stood near by, waiting for the
door to be closed.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the forester who showed us how William
Tyndale could be brought away from the dungeon
in Schouts' castle," Herman explained.  "You
remember what I told you of him?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, and since 'tis he, he is welcome for what
he did.  Let me look at him," Heinrich went on,
as soon as he had driven the bolt into the door,
and, taking up the lantern, he held it so that the
light fell full on Engel's weather-beaten face.
</p>

<p>
"I can trust you," he said, after a full scrutiny.
"But how late you are," he added half peevishly.
"'Tis time we started.  Hark!"
</p>

<p>
The great bell of the cathedral boomed out the
hour of ten, and Heinrich counted the strokes half
audibly before he moved.
</p>

<p>
"Stay where you are.  I'll bring the others
down, for 'twill be waste of time to go up the steps
only to come down again," he said peremptorily,
and he turned to mount the flight to bring the
others to them.
</p>

<p>
"But wait," cried Herman, "Mistress Margaret
must not go through the storm in all this rain and
wind without something warm on; and here are
things my mother sent for her."
</p>

<p>
Heinrich shrugged his shoulders impatiently.
He knew how precious the moments were, and this
meant delay.
</p>

<p>
"Give them to me, and hold this lantern!" he
exclaimed.  "I'll take them to her, and her mother
and mine will make her fit to travel."
</p>

<p>
He caught up the bundle and moved two steps
at a time, while Herman and Engel watched him
amusedly.
</p>

<p>
"He must have his own way.  Otherwise we
may confuse him," said Herman, as the simple
one entered the door at the top of the steps.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Herman and the forester who helped to
bring the Englishman out of the dungeon," they
heard him say in quick, sharp tones.  "And
Herman's mother has sent these warm, dry clothes
for Mistress Margaret.  But she must be quick.
The moments are precious.  The cathedral bell has
already struck ten, and what I have to do must
be done before eleven, or we are lost."
</p>

<p>
Herman saw him drop on his knees and unfasten
the bundle on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Why, the wind may blow how it will, and the
rain may come down in a flood, and you will be
both warm and dry!" he exclaimed, changing his
tone to ecstasy because of what he saw.  "But be
quick, for the love of God.  I want you to have
ample time, and cheat those creatures who are
seeking for you."
</p>

<p>
He stood at the top of the steps, his foot tapping
impatiently, and again and again, although the
moments were but few, glancing into the room to
see how Margaret was speeding in her preparations.
</p>

<p>
"At last!" he cried; and then, beckoning to
them to come, he descended the steps, where again
he waited for the others.
</p>

<p>
"Take this lantern, forester!" he exclaimed,
having hurriedly lighted one which hung on a
nail.
</p>

<p>
When the last one had come away from the steps,
and all were expecting him to open the door, which
rattled with the storm, he surprised them by dropping
on his knees near by where Margaret was standing,
holding Herman by the hand.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" she asked, wondering
why he did not open the stable door, and yet, like
the others, perplexed that he should have these
lights for the streets, and invite attention.
</p>

<p>
Heinrich's hands moved swiftly, and they watched
him with breathless interest.  His fingers were
sliding along the edges of some of the stones, and
he pulled them up one by one until he pointed to
a flat stone about two feet square.  His fingers
were soon busy with this, and he raised the stone,
leaning it back against the wall beneath the manger.
</p>

<p>
They looked into cold and forbidding blackness,
and felt a chill air come up which made them
shiver.  Heinrich caught up his lantern, and held
it far down in the dark opening, showing them
some wooden steps which rested on a stone floor.
</p>

<p>
"We are going down there," he said decisively,
putting one foot on the top step.  "Mother," he
said quietly, "when we are all gone, drop the stone
down and make all tidy.  I'll give you the sign when
I come back.  But perhaps I shall come along the
streets.  It all depends."
</p>

<p>
He was looking serious, but a smile came to his
face, and with his free hand he threw a kiss to his
mother, who was standing a little way back, listening,
as if to know whether anyone approached the stable
door, which was rattling violently with the wind.
</p>

<p>
Heinrich went down the steps swiftly, and stood
on the floor below, waiting.
</p>

<p>
"Come quickly!" he cried, standing back from
the steps to make room, but throwing a light on the
steps for the others to know where to put their
feet.
</p>

<p>
"I will go first.  Come close after me, my dear,"
Herman said to Margaret, who turned and kissed
the woman who had sheltered her.
</p>

<p>
Carefully placing her foot on the blackened step,
she descended slowly, clinging timidly to the
framework, but gathering courage as she went, until she
stood at Herman's side, waiting for the others.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," said Heinrich, when the others were
standing in a group about him, "shut up the hole
at once.  We will wait until 'tis done;" and the
woman, going on her knees, looked down to bid them
all God-speed, and a safe deliverance, before she
dropped the stone into its place.  They waited a
little longer, and heard her replacing the smaller
stones one by one, Heinrich counting each little
thud.
</p>

<p>
"That's the last," he said contentedly.  "Now
we can start."
</p>

<p>
He led the way across the empty chamber to
a door, bolted and barred; but Heinrich moved the
bolts and bars, ready to open the door.
</p>

<p>
"If I say put out the light, do it instantly, or else
cover it over with something.  Your cloak, forester,
is the very thing, and 'twill save the trouble of
lighting again.  And, mark this, whenever we come
to any door, let me always go in first to see that all is
clear, lest someone may be about.  Forester, cover
that light."
</p>

<p>
He hid his own lantern under the cloak he had
flung over his shoulders, and the whole company
stood in darkness, not knowing what Heinrich was
doing, nor where he went.  They heard no sound
which would tell them that he had opened the door;
but before long, and through the open doorway,
they saw a light.  Heinrich was there, waving the
lantern, and a low call came to them to come.
</p>

<p>
The forester brought his lantern from beneath his
cloak, and the little company moved forward in
wonder.  They found themselves in a great vault,
full of stores such as would be brought into the city
by the ships that came up or down the river.  There
were casks and boxes, coils of rope, chests of all
shapes and sizes, anchors and chains for the shipping,
barrels of biscuits and meat for sailors, a medley of
things brought down for storage, to be carried away
as the owner of the place had customers for them.
</p>

<p>
These were set down in such a way that there was
no clear path towards the spot where Heinrich was
standing, waiting for them.  At times Engel was
able to find a way, and threw the light of the lantern
on the floor, but many a time they had to climb over
the stores, stepping from one cask to another.
</p>

<p>
It was easy enough for the men, but for Margaret,
even with her spirit, and for her mother, who was
weakened by sickness, it was a task that made the
others anxious.  At last, however, they came to the
spot where Heinrich was awaiting them with the
greatest serenity.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know this place, Master Byrckmann?"
he asked, as if, now that they were really on the
move, he was enjoying the venture.
</p>

<p>
"I was never here," the printer answered, looking
about the great cellar, and seeking to recognise it, if
possible, with the aid of the two lanterns.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll show you something," said Heinrich
gleefully.  "Read that;" and he pointed to a huge
bale on which Byrckmann's name was printed in
rough characters.  "There's that, and that, and
that," said Heinrich, in quick succession, "and they
all have your name on it.  Can you guess now
where you are?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it in Bremner's warehouse?" the printer
asked, in some amazement.
</p>

<p>
"That is the very thing," cried Heinrich; but he
stopped and stared behind him, listening intently.
</p>

<p>
"Come after me.  Oh, come quickly!" and he
led the way, showing the others where he went by
flashing his lantern in such a manner that they
saw all that he did.  "Now in here! quickly! and
bend low.  Crawl in among the bales," he
whispered.  "Bear away to the left, forester, and
you will find a hiding-place among those planks.
Then when I say it, cover up the lantern.  Don't let
a chink of light come through, or we may be lost."
</p>

<p>
The forester dropped on his hands and knees, and
already Heinrich had covered his own light under
his cloak.  Squeezing his great form in between
some heavy bales of cloth, Engel crawled along,
while the others followed him, all save Herman,
who remained with Heinrich to see what this
threatening danger was.
</p>

<p>
"Art safely inside?" came Heinrich's whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," was the answer.  "Although 'tis a tight
fit for so many," said Engel, with an assumption of
ease he did not feel.  Better, he thought, that they
had taken the risk of the streets and gone to Herman's
house to take that underground passage to the river.
The same thought was in Herman's mind, but it was
too late now.  They were in God's hands, and they
must abide by the issue of this venture, which might
well mean life or death.
</p>

<p>
"A tight fit, didst say, forester?" Heinrich
whispered.  "I spent many a night there and
found it large enough; but, hush!  Cover the light.
You are safe there, and only need patience."
</p>

<p>
Herman, watching with him, felt his heart almost
freeze at what he saw.  Away through the door
which Herman had already opened, he could see a
great chamber like this in which they were hiding,
choked as this one was, with stores.  But what he
centred his attention on was a company of men,
six of them in all, each carrying a lantern, and
finding their way among the merchandise, and at the
same time approaching this cellar in which Margaret
and himself and the others were hiding.
</p>

<p>
He went sick with dread when the men came
through the doorway, where they halted in a group.
</p>

<p>
"Is this the last?" asked one, and Herman not
only knew the voice, but saw the face of the
speaker as the lanterns threw their light on it.
</p>

<p>
It was Cochlaeus!  The Captain of the City
Guard was there, and a third was one whom Herman
knew, Bremner, the owner of the great warehouses
on the quay, and the wealthiest man in the city.
The others were ecclesiastics whom Herman had
seen, either in the streets, or taking part in the
cathedral services.
</p>

<p>
"This is the last," said Bremner, standing apart
for a moment, and staring about him with an air of
proprietorship.  "And as for strength, you have
nothing stronger in the Holy House, and nothing
better suited for your purpose, since you may make
as many cells here as you please.  And every outer
wall is three feet thick in stone and cement.  The
very place for new quarters, which you seem anxious
to add to the place you already have."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis true," said Cochlaeus.  "But I like not
your price," he added, as he moved in and out among
the goods that were stored so thickly in the place.
"'Tis two thousand golden crowns too much, and
even at that lower price you make it far too dear."
</p>

<p>
He spoke petulantly.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis for our Mother Church, and you should bear
that in mind!" he exclaimed, when he moved still
nearer to where Herman and Heinrich were standing.
</p>

<p>
"I bear it in mind," Bremner's answer came.
"I have again and again refused the price I asked
you at the first, but because it is for the glory of God,
I named this low figure."
</p>

<p>
"Two thousand crowns too much!" reiterated
Cochlaeus.  "You forget how many crowns we
shall have to spend to make it fit for our purpose."
</p>

<p>
"Nay.  But I do not want to sell," cried Bremner
half impatiently, restraining himself because of his
knowledge of the temper of this man with whom,
by this unlucky chance, he was dealing.  "I shall
have to spend five thousand crowns more than you
will give me to buy another storage place, so that I
stand to lose a great deal."
</p>

<p>
"And you get the Church's blessing.  Fall in with
the price I name, and I will secure you favours
rarely granted to any like yourself!" exclaimed
Cochlaeus, stopping abruptly, not many feet away
from where Herman and Heinrich were crouching,
and in readiness to go into that hiding-place where
the others were sheltering.  He faced Bremner, and
said peremptorily, "Your last word in this matter."
</p>

<p>
There was something almost menacing in the
tone, and Herman saw Bremner's face.  It became
white with fear, and he saw, as well, how the man's
hand trembled as his fingers rested on his lips.
"The Church must have it," he said falteringly.
</p>

<p>
Cochlaeus answered back exultantly.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis noble of you, Bremner.  I knew you would
fall in with my wishes, and you shall not be a loser."
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a time, and then, anxious
though Herman was, his fear was almost more than
he could endure, because of the possible
consequences to Margaret and those others near by in
hiding.  Cochlaeus broke the silence and pointed to
the wall against which Herman's back was resting.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go yonder just to be assured that the walls
are as firm as these others;" and because he could
not pass on the floor, he stepped on some bales, and
stepped from one to another, each step bringing him
closer to the spot.
</p>

<p>
"Get inside," said Heinrich, whose teeth were
chattering, and they had barely joined the others
when Cochlaeus sprang from one of the bales to
the floor, so close to Herman that, had he stretched
out his hand, he could have gripped the Churchman
by the ankles.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; they seem as good," said Cochlaeus; and
then he paused to look around again.
</p>

<p>
"I would that there were time to look all round,
but I must be gone.  There are three at least who
must be in our hands to-night, and be safely lodged
in the dungeons of the Holy House.  One is that
Byrckmann whose bales of paper I have seen
yonder.  There is his wife, as well; and there is,
besides, his daughter, who has contrived to escape
from the Holy House, and must be even now in her
father's house."
</p>

<p>
Bremner spoke quietly, and his voice was tremulous.
</p>

<p>
"I have known Byrckmann all my lifetime,
and I believe him a faithful son of the Church," he
ventured.  "I can't believe him capable of heresy."
</p>

<p>
"A man may deceive his best friends," said
Cochlaeus shortly.  "At all events, he is to be
waited on.  I must go."
</p>

<p>
And, standing again on one of the bales, he moved
away, as he had come, and before long the vault
was in darkness again.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br><br>
THE HOUSE ON THE WALL
</h3>

<p>
Herman and Heinrich came out swiftly from
their hiding-place, whispering back to the
forester to stay near the others and protect
them.  When Engel gave his assent, they
ventured stealthily through the vaults, using one
of the lanterns when necessary.
</p>

<p>
They were bent on assuring themselves that
Cochlaeus and those who were with him were really
gone, and as they dogged their steps nearly all the
time in darkness, Heinrich whispering to Herman
when to turn to right or left among the storage,
they scarcely lost sight of those whom they were
following.
</p>

<p>
Not one among them all, so far as they could tell,
turned to look back, and at last they mounted some
broad stone steps into the warehouse on a level with
the wharf.  Listening intently, Herman and his
companion heard the jingle of keys, the creaking of
great hinges, the sound of heavy boots on some
stones, and the noisy clang of the door as it was
closed.  The key turned in the lock again, and all
was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Gone!" exclaimed Heinrich, in a tone of relief.
"I was fearful lest we should be found when
Cochlaeus came so near to our hiding-place.  If he
had discovered us, with all those armed men near,
what would it have availed to fight?"
</p>

<p>
He shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"Didst hear my teeth chatter, Herman?  It
was from real fright," he confessed openly.  "But
come.  The way is clear, and since they have locked
the door the place must be empty of any men
who could challenge us.  Come at once.  We'll get
out of the city before that Churchman finds that
his birds have flown, and there are not many
minutes left before he will be at the printer's
door."
</p>

<p>
He turned away, and hurried back, winding in
and out among the merchandise, using his lantern
freely for Herman to see the way; and as soon as
he was within the doorway of the cellar in which
Margaret and the others were in hiding, he threw
all caution to the winds.
</p>

<p>
"Come at once.  The way is clear," he cried.
"Forester, help Mistress Byrckmann.  Take her
in your strong arms if needs be, and Mistress
Margaret and her father can carry the lantern and show
you where to step."
</p>

<p>
He had scarcely ended before Margaret had come
away, and Herman could see her holding up the
lantern.  Then her father came, handing out his
wife, and last of all was Otto Engel, who did as
Heinrich suggested when he saw that already
Margaret's mother was overwrought and
unequal to the call upon her strength.
</p>

<p>
"Lead on!" he exclaimed, as he bent low
and gathered up the sick woman in his strong
arms.
</p>

<p>
Heinrich led them up the stone steps and past
the great double gates, on through the great
warehouses, which were windowless, through the stables
where the horses looked round at them sleepily,
until they stopped at a door which opened outwards.
As they paused there they could hear the wind
screaming past the door outside, and the rain patter
against the woodwork, as well as bubble in at the
doorstep, blown there by the gale which was sweeping
across the city.
</p>

<p>
"We must hide our lights the moment I open the
door," said Heinrich; "but don't put them out,
for we shall want them presently.  Art ready,
Herman?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," came the answer, for Herman had taken
the lantern from Margaret and had led her by the
hand through these dark places, always alert for
any danger that might menace her.
</p>

<p>
They could hear the stealthy slipping of the bolts,
and then the scarcely stifled creaking of the hinges
as the wind drove in the door the moment the latch
was lifted.
</p>

<p>
"Pass out, one by one," said Heinrich.  "Bend
your head, forester, for the door is only a low one.
Ah!  I thought as much.  Hast hurt thyself?"
he asked, in some concern, when Engel caught his
forehead against the lintel.
</p>

<p>
"Not much," whispered the forester, although
the blow had staggered him.  "Fortunately I was
going slowly."  But with that he stood in the open
with the wind playing about his face.
</p>

<p>
"What next?" asked Herman.
</p>

<p>
"I'll shut this door to save suspicion, if the wind
will let me do as much," said Heinrich, struggling
to pull the door together, but failing till Herman
caught it, and closed it on the latch after putting
both hands to the task.
</p>

<p>
"The street is empty.  Now follow me."
</p>

<p>
Heinrich crossed the road, his form dimly showing
in the darkness, and the others followed, swaying
and staggering with the wind, the forester more
than once beating against the wall while carrying
Margaret's sick mother.
</p>

<p>
Heinrich moved down an alley, going slowly, each
holding out a hand to either side to keep in touch
with the wall, and feeling with their feet, not to trip
over any projecting doorstep.  No harm came,
and then the alley was left behind.
</p>

<p>
Where they were none knew, save Heinrich, for
the darkness was dense, and the street into which
they emerged was like so many others, narrow and
tortuous, with the wind screeching along and causing
the swinging signs to creak and scream as they
moved before the blast.
</p>

<p>
"As straight across the street as you can go,"
said Heinrich aloud, and even then they barely
heard him in the roar of the wind and the pelting
rain.  He moved forward, but staggered, and, his
frail form unable to withstand the rush of wind,
he fell heavily on the stones.
</p>

<p>
"Art hurt?" Byrckmann asked anxiously,
stretching out a hand to help the poor fellow to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Not much.  Only bruised a bit.  But that
won't count," he added cheerfully.  "Come along."
</p>

<p>
They reached the other side of the street, but,
going past the door of an empty house, Heinrich
led them down a side passage and halted in
comparative calm at a doorway.
</p>

<p>
"We are here," he said, when they had
again grouped about him.  "And here, please
God, we shall find respite from the wind and
rain, and, better still, confound that monster,
Cochlaeus."
</p>

<p>
He chuckled as he pulled a key from his bosom,
and, telling them to go carefully and turn a little to
the right when they were once inside, he waited for
them to file in, standing like one on guard at the
doorstep to keep out any intruders.
</p>

<p>
"Feel your way!" he exclaimed, when he had
closed and bolted the door on the inside.  "We
dare not show a light on this side of the
house.  Put out your hands, and that will help
you.  Ready?  I'll count the steps I take.  One,
two, three."
</p>

<p>
He counted up to fourteen and halted, and
again the others, groping in the darkness, were
about him.  There was no sound while they stood
in stillness, save the howling wind outside and the
scramble near them of a startled rat who was
taken by surprise at the intrusion.
</p>

<p>
"We are going up a stone staircase, which tends
to the right the whole way.  I have counted the
steps scores of times, for I have often been here,
and there are twenty-eight of them.  Now come
after me.  I'll throw you a light as soon as we
take the first bend, for there are no windows this
side of the house, and no one can see us; not even
the City Guard if 'tis bold enough to come out on
such a night."
</p>

<p>
He hurried up the stairs in the darkness without
any hesitation, because every step was familiar,
and after he had mounted a dozen he threw some
light on the stone staircase to show the others
where to go.  From this point they mounted the
remaining steps, both lanterns showing light, and
those who followed him watched in wonder.  The
staircase had its way in solid masonry.  Here and
there were slits in the walls, just wide enough for a
man's head to fit in, but too narrow even for a child
to enter, and each slit was eight or ten feet deep,
perhaps more.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we?" asked Herman, looking about him.
</p>

<p>
"You shall see presently," was the lightly spoken
answer.  Heinrich was exuberant.  Whether danger
had passed or not, the others could not say, but his
gay spirits, in contrast to his previous care, gave
them confidence, and they followed him without
hesitation.  At the top of the steps he turned into
a room, so small that a tall man could hardly lie
full length upon the floor, while the place itself
was hemmed in by, or formed a part of, some solid
masonry.
</p>

<p>
In one side of the room was a window,
broad enough even for a man of Otto Engel's
proportions to crawl through, but to pass through
it was impossible, for there were bars from top
to bottom, and bars crossed these from right to
left.
</p>

<p>
"What's next?" asked the forester, who had
gently placed Margaret's mother on the stone floor,
and now stood panting with his struggle against the
storm when so heavily burdened.
</p>

<p>
"We're going through that window," said Heinrich,
with quiet assurance and a contented smile on
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Art mad?" cried Engel, staring at the
bars and then at their guide.  "Who could get
through that window with those irons crossed
like that?" he asked almost angrily, half disposed
to think that this poor madman had duped them
and had brought them here to no purpose, unless
to hide and starve, unless he could bring them
food.
</p>

<p>
Heinrich laughed outright, and rubbed his hands.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you would say as much," he answered
gleefully.  "But wait.  Have patience, and ere
many minutes have gone you shall be outside the
city."
</p>

<p>
He was serious now, and they watched him
wonderingly, still thinking him mad.  He went
out of the room, and they heard his boots beating
on the stone steps as he clattered down them
in the darkness.  A suspicion came that he had
served them treacherously and had gone away,
leaving them in this empty house, which might, for
aught they knew, be some part of the Holy House,
and this one of the dens in which some poor prisoner
would sigh out his hours, by day and night, until
the tormentors chose to deal with him.  Even
Herman and Engel felt their faces blench as this
thought thrilled them, and Margaret, who feared
as much as they, put her hand in Herman's arm
and drew closer to him.
</p>

<p>
"Has he tricked us, think you?" asked
the forester, going to the door to stare down
into the darkness of the stone staircase.  But
when he had stood there a moment or two
he heard returning footsteps, and Heinrich came
up, two steps at a time, carrying a coil of strong
rope.
</p>

<p>
"Didst think I'd gone and left you all?" he
asked half roguishly.  This gay side of him had
rendered him oblivious of their anxiety, and he was
gloating over their surprise when he let them into
his secret.
</p>

<p>
"I did," said the forester, completely puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"You might have trusted me," Heinrich exclaimed
half reproachfully as he uncoiled the rope,
making them wonder all the more.  As he threw
down the last coil, he crawled along the stone
recess to where the bars were, and then they were
amazed.  One by one he took a bar in his hands as
he knelt before them.  Lifting one, as if it fitted into
a socket, he drew it away and laid it by his side.
He did the same with another, and yet with more,
until every bar was lying on the great stone
window-sill, and there was a clear and open space
as soon as he threw the glass window back on
its hinges, broad enough even for the forester to
pass.
</p>

<p>
While they watched him in silence, he leant out
and gazed about in all directions; now to right, to
left, and downwards, and, satisfied with what he
saw, he came back to them in happy complacence.
</p>

<p>
"Go and look for yourselves!" he exclaimed, as
his feet touched the floor; and the forester, nearest
to the window, climbed up and moved on his hands
and knees to the opening.  The others heard him
exclaim in wonder, and presently he came backwards,
and was once more with the others.
</p>

<p>
"Heinrich!" he exclaimed, catching at the
simple one's hands, "I wronged thee, and from
the bottom of my heart I crave pardon.  You have
brought us to deliverance."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis true," said Herman, who had gone into the
embrasure and, having gazed for a few moments,
turned round to speak back to the others.  "We
are on the outside of the city.  This is part of the
city wall; yonder is the river, and the harbour too,
and away here to our right, close by, is the forest
which leads to Engel's hut.  Margaret, we are safe
if we can manage to let ourselves down by that
rope, and if you and your mother have courage
enough to be lowered so far.  And yet," he added
doubtfully, "I know not how the last one can come,
for it will want a stronger man than Heinrich, even
with the most willing heart, to lower the lightest of
us."
</p>

<p>
Heinrich laughed and skipped about in childish
glee.
</p>

<p>
"Come back and I will show you!" he exclaimed.
"Besides, 'tis well not to waste time," he added,
changing suddenly to seriousness.
</p>

<p>
Herman crawled back, and was near to the
edge to drop on the floor when Heinrich stopped
him.
</p>

<p>
"See!" he said, taking one of the bars; and,
scraping away some of the mortar which was
powdered only, but carefully catching every grain
in his cap so that none should be wasted and fall
to the floor, he drove the bar far into a hitherto
unseen hole so that it stayed firm in the wall.
He took the rope, and, making a strong loop at
one end, he passed it over this, and they understood.
</p>

<p>
The last that came could lower himself by sliding
down the rope, whereas the others could be let
down safely with a loop and a sliding knot about
their body.
</p>

<p>
"Who will go first?" asked Heinrich.
</p>

<p>
"Someone who can help the women when their
turn comes," suggested the forester.  "Suppose
you go first, Herman.  Then Mistress Margaret, and
then her mother, and her father to follow.  After
that, either Heinrich or myself."
</p>

<p>
The noose went round Herman's body, under
his arms, and, not to lay any strain on the others, he
threw out the whole of the rope that was at liberty,
and suffered himself to go down, hand under hand,
until his feet touched the ground below.  He
loosened the rope, and when it was drawn back,
Margaret came to the window, and he dimly saw
her sitting in the loop and clinging to the rope
while they were lowering her gently, but swaying
in the furious wind.  Before many moments she
was in his arms, and he covered her face with
kisses.
</p>

<p>
"God is going to send us into safety," she
answered, throwing her arms about his neck and
clinging to him in the darkness until it was time
to render service to her mother, whose turn was
next.
</p>

<p>
The last to come was Heinrich, who had gone
down that rope so many times, and they gathered
about him to bless and thank him for what he had
done.
</p>

<p>
"Heinrich," said Margaret, taking him by the
hand, "in God's dear mercy you have been our
deliverer.  We owe so much to you&mdash;our lives, I
doubt not, and our liberty."
</p>

<p>
He stood and gazed at her in happy laughter.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas God who made me your helper," he
said, his voice thrilling with gladness.  "But
you must be gone.  Yonder is the forest, and
the forester knows it well.  He can lead you
there ten times better than I.  Now I am going
back to my mother, for if Cochlaeus has bought
those vaults he will not fail to find his way
into our home.  We must find another.  Perhaps
they will suffer us to live in this house we have
just left."
</p>

<p>
"God speed you!" he exclaimed, careless of
the wind and rain, and holding out his hand
to each of them in turn, but keeping Margaret
for the last.  When she gave him hers, he drew
off her glove and covered the hand with kisses,
not heeding how the rain came like pellets on
his uncovered head.  She knew not whether the
drops which fell on her hand were rain or
tears.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Heinrich," she said, almost weeping.
"I shall never forget.  Oh, never!  I shall never
fail to remember how you were ready to give your
life for mine."
</p>

<p>
She made him glad almost to delirium when she
put up her hands and drew his wet face to hers,
and kissed him on both cheeks.  He hurried away
to the wall with happy laughter, and when he had
climbed up the rope and they knew that he was
safe within the house, Engel took Margaret's mother
in his arms, and the little company walked on into
the dark forest.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
<br><br>
THE NIGHT RIDE IN THE FOREST
</h3>

<p>
Once within the shelter of the forest, Engel
placed Margaret's mother carefully at the
root of one of the giant oaks and on the
sheltered side, so that neither wind nor
rain could harm her.
</p>

<p>
"We will wait here a little while," he said quietly,
"and that will give you time to recover a bit from
all the exertion and pain to which our adventures
have put you, Mistress Byrckmann."
</p>

<p>
"No, let us not stay!" she exclaimed, taking her
husband's hand, and by an effort which surprised him
drawing herself on to her feet, where she stood
with her hands on his arm.  "Let us go forward.
They will find that we have left our home, and they
will say that we must have left the city; then
they will come here to search for us."
</p>

<p>
Shuddering at the thought, and weak though she
was, she drew her husband forward.
</p>

<p>
"Then you shall take my arm; or, better still,
since I am fresh and Engel is not, I will carry you!"
exclaimed Herman; and before she could say a
word by way of protest, he had her frail body in his
arms.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead," he said, when Engel protested that
he was equal to three or four miles more.  "Show
the way, since no one knows the forest as you do."
</p>

<p>
More than once, when the wind howled among
the trees and made the going dangerous because
great branches sometimes broke away and crashed
to the ground, the travellers thought they heard
the cries of men, and they paused to know whether
they were being pursued.  When an hour had gone,
and Margaret's mother had twice changed bearers,
the forester said they were nearing a farm where
he thought he could hire some horses.  He was
going to point to a clearing where the house was
standing when the sound of a horse's hoofs was
heard, in spite of the swish of the forest leaves in
the storm.
</p>

<p>
"They are after us!" said Margaret, in awestricken
tones, and she looked around, dark though it was,
to know if any place offered for their hiding.
</p>

<p>
"Come this way!" the forester exclaimed, and,
having just given up his burden to Herman, he caught
at Margaret's hand.  He drew her, and the others
followed, among the bushes, away from the road, and
waited in hiding to know what the sounds meant.
</p>

<p>
The horse came on, regardless of the road, and
in the darkness he was making for the bush behind
which they waited.  The creature came close to
them, not seeing where he went in his evident terror,
or else spurred on by his rider, but he stumbled at
a hidden root, made doubly treacherous by the
rain, and fell heavily.  His rider crashed against a
tree, and fell without a groan and lay still, while
the horse, scrambling to his feet, dashed away into
the darkness and was no more seen.
</p>

<p>
The forester ran to the rider, and, bending over
him, lifted him in his arms; but he laid him down
again.
</p>

<p>
"He is dead," he said quietly.  "His neck is
broken."
</p>

<p>
Horror-stricken at the tragedy, they moved on,
leaving the dead man where he lay, and did not
stop until they reached a spot where the bushes
were so dense that even in broad daylight they
would scarcely be seen.
</p>

<p>
"I'll leave you here while I go to a farm near
by and wake up the master.  He has horses he can
lend me if I pay the price."  He paused.  "I
doubt whether he will let me have them without
the money down," he added hesitatingly.  "I
haven't enough with me."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis my charge, Engel," said Byrckmann.
"Take my purse, and use it as you deem best."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, now I can get them easily!" the forester
exclaimed, with elation.  "Keep well in the shelter
here, and neither Cochlaeus nor all the City Guard
will see you if they bring a hundred lanterns to light
up the forest."
</p>

<p>
He went away, and for a long hour they waited for
his coming, hearing all the sounds of the forest, the
moaning wind, the cracking of roots like the rattle
of musketry as some great tree was torn up and fell
with a crash.  Even the animals who had their
home there were too startled to trouble themselves
about those who were coming by night into their
domain, and the fugitives could hear them whimpering
in their terror.
</p>

<p>
The hour seemed never ending.  The moments
were leaden-footed, and more than once Margaret's
mother expressed her fear that Engel had left them
to get through the forest how they could.
</p>

<p>
"Don't say that&mdash;don't even think it&mdash;of Otto
Engel," Herman protested.  "He is the soul of
honour.  The farmer must be a heavy sleeper, hard
to awake; or there may be some difficulty in getting
as many horses as we need all ready for the journey.
And Engel would insist on their having a good meal
of corn.  All takes time."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour more went by, with longer moments
still in it, it seemed to the anxious watchers, but
then they heard some neighing horses, and the
tramp of hoofs, sounding more plainly because the
fierceness of the storm had passed.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you?" came the sonorous cry of the
forester, and Herman called back; so that he was
soon with them, leading a string of five horses,
saddled and ready for hard travelling.  One of them
had a pannier, so arranged that Margaret's mother,
when the forester lifted her into it, was able to ride
in comfort.
</p>

<p>
"It was that which took up the time," Engel
explained.  "It took an amount of contriving, but the
farmer was willing enough; and, if Master Byrckmann
doesn't begrudge the money, I gave him five
extra golden crowns to keep discreet silence if any
questions were asked.  But I'd trust Brune without
the bribe, for he loves Cochlaeus no more than I,
and has a grudge against him and those who follow
his lead."
</p>

<p>
Herman lifted Margaret into her saddle, and, helping
her father into his, he sprang into his own seat,
and the company rode on through the forest.
</p>

<p>
"We must go in single file," said the forester, when
they came to a path made faintly visible because
the rain had ceased, and although the clouds were
spread along the sky, the moon had begun to make
herself felt.  "Herman, bring up the rear.  I want
to get first of all to my hut, and then I'll tell you
what is working in my mind."
</p>

<p>
They were moving now among the trees, and the
forester from time to time spoke back a word of
warning, when to bend and avoid the trees.
</p>

<p>
"Trust to me!" he exclaimed once, when all
seemed wrong.  "I am like a cat in the dark, and I
am going the way I want to go, and a way I know."
</p>

<p>
His sturdy confidence robbed his companions of
their fears.  Grown accustomed to the darkness,
they could see his thick frame, the well-set head on
the broad, square shoulders.  At times, as the darkness
grew less dense, they could see his body bend, and
they, too, without his words, though he sent them
back to them, lowered their heads to pass the
branches.  But even thus Margaret more than once,
when an occasional gust of wind came, felt the
branches whip her face, making it smart with pain.
</p>

<p>
Unexpectedly the forester dropped out of his
saddle.
</p>

<p>
"This is my house," he said, coming to Margaret's
side to help her dismount.  He lifted her mother out
of her pannier as though she was little more than a
child, while the printer, unused to the saddle, felt
himself standing on his feet almost before he knew.
</p>

<p>
"Tie up the horses, Herman, over there, where 'tis
in the dark.  Then come to the hut.  We must
have something to eat, and I want, as well, to take
my dog with me.  I may be away a few days, and the
dear fellow would starve if I left him here."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later they were in the saddle again,
the horses, as well as themselves, the better for a
meal.  Before he moved on he explained his purpose.
"I want to work our way round Schouts' castle,
where the path is little more than a sheep walk; but
we can do it.  I can't conceive that anyone would
be out on such a night as we have had, so that we
need have no fear that the robber lord's retainers
will bar our way."
</p>

<p>
A thrill of fear passed through the others, but
they had confidence in him, and followed his lead
without demur; but when they had gone some
distance the forester called a halt, and the company
grouped about him, wondering what was wrong.
</p>

<p>
"We're too near the robber's den," said Engel
quietly.  "I can see the castle lights.  And would
you believe it?  There are torches moving on the
slope, and Schouts and his men are out for their
savage work," he muttered.  "Follow me.  I'm
going farther into the forest before we ride direct to
our destination.  I had no idea that there would be
piracy on such a night, and at this mad hour!"
</p>

<p>
Turning his back on the castle and the river, he
rode on into the darkest part of the forest, frightening
some of the creatures who had already feared the
storm.  When he had gone a mile or more, he
turned sharply round, and presently they came to an
open glade, which they could clearly see, in contrast
with the dense wood through which they had been
riding.
</p>

<p>
"We must cross that bit of grass, and from that
moment you may all dismiss your fears," said the
forester, in a lighter tone than he had used that
night.  "I have gone through the forest a hundred
times and never saw anything human in it yet in
these parts.  And what is more, there is no path, so
that I must pick my way, and you must follow."
</p>

<p>
The forester went forward like a man with an
easy mind.  Any fears which the others had,
dropped away from them when they heard him
talking to his horse, or whistling a song which the
Protestants sang in their secret forest meetings.
Margaret rode at Herman's side, so much at ease
with this new confidence that she could talk with
him.
</p>

<p>
They rode on for a couple of hours, and then the
dawn came.  Almost insensibly they halted to
watch the beauty of the morning after such a night
of storm.  The sun came up in silvery splendour
above a wooded hill, and a radiance seemed to rest
as on a cushion of the mist.  Trees and undergrowth,
forest path and fallen branches, were all hidden
until the daylight conquered, and the great orb of
day, riding above the wooded depths, sent forth his
light, so that there was no more night, and no more
mist.
</p>

<p>
But with the glory of the new day, and the songs
of the birds, there came a thrill of fear.  A forest
clearing was before them, and beyond it they saw
the great river rolling by.  In the midst of the
clearing was a hut, and already some blue smoke was
curling from its solitary chimney.
</p>

<p>
Margaret's eyes fastened on the place, and her
eyes betrayed her fear.
</p>

<p>
"Is it not dangerous to be so near that house?"
she asked, turning her anxious face to the forester.
He laughed at her words.
</p>

<p>
"Fritz Schiller is as true a Protestant as any
man in the land.  Ask him for a Lutheran Testament,
and he will show you one.  Let anyone ask
him for you if you are sheltering in his home, and if
he has promised to hide you he would die rather than
betray you.  I had thought at one time of bringing
William Tyndale here, but took him instead to the
mere near my father's house, but not because I did
not trust this man."
</p>

<p>
"Fritz!" the forester shouted, his stentorian
voice startling the birds that were near, as soon as
he had dropped out of his saddle.
</p>

<p>
Crossing the clearing, he shouted again, and
banged at the door of the hut.  It opened presently,
and a man stood in the doorway whom Margaret and
her father had seen in the streets of the city, but
did not know.
</p>

<p>
"What art doing here, Engel?" asked the grey-bearded
man, who held a hatchet in one hand and a
block of wood in the other.
</p>

<p>
They heard so much, but what followed they did
not know, until the forester called on them to come
forward and bring his own horse with them.
</p>

<p>
"We're to stay here till it is safe to go forward,"
said Engel.  "The river is too wild to cross, and we
may wait here for a day or two, but there is nothing
now to fear.  You can rest in sweet content, Mistress
Byrckmann, and as soon as we can manage it, you
will be safely over the river, and out of danger."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap29"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br><br>
THE NIGHT RIDER'S CALL
</h3>

<p>
They were away at day-dawn, and long before
the sun had risen they had crossed the river
in the great ferry boat, which carried them
and their horses safely to the other side.
They rode direct for the forest there, and Engel,
who knew every yard of the path, was making for
his father's mill.  Unexpectedly the miller himself
was in the path when they were but three miles
from what they thought would be that day's journey
end.
</p>

<p>
"Is all right?" Engel asked anxiously, reining
in his horse.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thank God.  But I came on the chance of
meeting you and saving you a useless journey.  As
the good man seemed anxious to get a little nearer
to Doctor Martin Luther, and because the way was
clear, I sent him across to Raymart's hut, and there
he is safe, and the more content because he is a few
miles nearer to his destination."
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll ride on at once, father," said Engel,
who swung round into another forest path, with
the others following.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly evening when they halted outside a
charcoal-burner's hut, and when they entered the
humble home they saw William Tyndale seated at
a table with a Lutheran Testament on one knee
and two other books open before him.  Opposite
to him sat William Roye, a pile of papers on either
hand, writing, while in low and thoughtful, and
sometimes hesitating tones, weighing in his mind
the value of one word against another, his master
dictated to him.
</p>

<p>
They were so absorbed in their work that neither
of the men had heard the tramp of horses, nor the
voices of the riders.  Not until Margaret had spoken,
as she stood in the open doorway of the room, did
they look up; and then Tyndale, laying down his
book, came to her with outstretched hands.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Tyndale spent the whole of the night in preparation
for his journey to the town which he looked
upon as "a desired haven."  He anticipated that
when he got there he would often be in Martin
Luther's company, and have his advice on many
a point which perplexed him, scholar though he
was.
</p>

<p>
Those who lay in the charcoal-burner's hut, or in
his stable, wherever room could be found for so
many, could hear him moving about in the tiny
inner room, going lovingly over the sheets in the
pile of manuscript which he had dictated to Roye.
Sometimes he came to a line on which his forefinger
rested, and his face betrayed his anxiety as to
whether it was the best phrase possible.  Time was
precious to him, since the journey was to begin at
dawn, and he would have but little space for sleep;
but he sat down presently, and, taking up his pen,
scored out a word and put another in its place.
</p>

<p>
He sat on thus, forgetful of everything until
Herman, who came in from the stream which ran dancing
in the morning sun, fresh after bathing his head
and face in its cool waters, saw him sitting at the
table, lost in thought.
</p>

<p>
"Master Tyndale!" he cried.  "Have you forgotten?
It is dawn, and we start at once.  The
horses are saddled and at the door."
</p>

<p>
Tyndale looked up, as one forgetful of everything.
It was only slowly that he realised the meaning of
the young man's words, and he sprang to his feet,
his face displaying his concern.
</p>

<p>
"I quite forgot, Herman!" he exclaimed.  "That
passage in Romans had been on my mind ever since
you left me in the marsh, and when I came across it
in the manuscript, it occurred to me how it ought
to run, so I sat to put it right.  Fasten these in the
wallet while I get ready, my son.  I will break my
fast while we ride through the forest."
</p>

<p>
When Herman had packed the wallet, and had
carried it out to bestow it in the saddle, Tyndale
shut the door softly and dropped on his knees at
the table.  The birds were in full song outside, and
the horses snorted and moved about restlessly, but
Tyndale neither heard them nor thought of the
glories of the newborn day.  The all-absorbing
thought was the well-doing of his work.  He was
working as "under the Great Taskmaster's eye";
and now that he was kneeling, he asked for a safe
journey for the work's sake, for strength and
quietness until the task was ended.  And then&mdash;ah! then
the ending could come in what form it would.
</p>

<p>
He came into the sunlight with a face full of
thought; but the gay greeting from Margaret roused
him to note his surroundings.  He smiled pleasantly
when he saw her, beautiful in the fresh morning air,
with the sun sparkling in her dark eyes and her lips
parted as they gave the morning salutation.
</p>

<p>
"I am late, and I crave your pardon, friends.
Herman, give me a lift into that high saddle, for I
am not as active as I was a score of years ago."
</p>

<p>
The little company rode down the forest glade.
Blithe though the morning was, they went in silence,
for they were beginning a dangerous journey.  At
first the path was fairly well marked, for Raymart's
cart had gone that way three or four times a week
for many a year, carrying charcoal to the town; but
when they scanned the narrowing track farther on
into the forest, they thought to take the beaten road.
</p>

<p>
They halted sharply, just as the forester's horse
had stepped away from the trees.  Glancing along
the road, he saw some horsemen, and by the glancing
steel in the sunshine, he knew them to be soldiers.
He reined his horse back on the instant, and, saying
what he had seen, he led the way more deeply into
the forest and took a more unfrequented path.  It
was the only thing he could do when it was possible
that the horsemen were under the command of
Cochlaeus, again in pursuit of Tyndale.
</p>

<p>
The path which Engel took through the forest
was at first tolerable, but in time it was nothing
more than a mere track, very narrow, winding
among thorny creepers, and over beds of decaying
leaves, but that did not deter them.  At odd times
they saw a village, and two or three times, approaching
with care, they ventured into a quiet inn to
get food.  But they were compelled in the end
to take the public road.
</p>

<p>
The sun was low down, and sent his golden,
slanting beams among the fir trees when they left
the forest, in which they had travelled for so many
hours.  There was an inn on the roadside, and,
taking the risks because their horses, like
themselves, were tired, they rode up to the door as
carelessly as though there had been no need for care.
The open space in front of the inn was clear.  None
were sitting at the tables under the trees on the
opposite side of the road, and the house bore the
aspect of quietude, almost of desertion.
</p>

<p>
Engel stayed outside to look to the comfort of
the horses, but the others moved along the passage,
thinking to go to the general room, but before they
got as far as the door a woman came.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis full, lady," she said, turning to Mistress
Byrckmann.  "But I can find you room elsewhere,
if you do not mind it being small," she added
pleasantly, looking at the sick one and marking
how worn out she was.
</p>

<p>
"Anywhere, so long as we may rest, and these
two ladies may presently lie somewhere in quiet and
comfort," interposed Herman.  "They are both
very tired, for we have had a long journey."
</p>

<p>
"Come this way," the woman answered, turning
away to the stairs.  She took them up to a large
room which opened into one on either side.  "There
is a sleeping-room there, for the ladies!" she
exclaimed, moving towards the door, which she flung
wide open, and waited for Margaret and her mother
to enter.  The room was small, but clean, and
Margaret smiled her thanks in a way which won
the woman's heart.
</p>

<p>
"The others must do as they can," she said,
going back to them.  "There is that little inner
room, but this room will do to sleep in if you
will let me send a man up with some clean straw.
I am sorry I can't do more.  Will it do?"
</p>

<p>
"Excellently well," said Byrckmann, glad like
the others that for that night they would sleep
under a roof, whereas they had expected to lie down
beneath the stars.
</p>

<p>
Before long the mistress of the inn had brought
them up a meal which was appetising to hungry
travellers.  She bade them eat and be at ease, and
left them; but Herman and the forester saw with
much disquiet how she looked at Margaret and
then at Tyndale.
</p>

<p>
"What did that mean, think you?" Engel
asked in little more than a whisper when they
presently stood at the window, looking out on the
long, white road which lost itself in the growing
darkness of the evening.
</p>

<p>
"And yet it was not an unkind look," said
Herman.  "It seemed to me that she was
concerned&mdash;that there was some kind solicitude, and
when she glanced away from Tyndale to Margaret
it was as though she felt a womanly tenderness for
her."
</p>

<p>
"I pray God you may be right," the forester
answered.
</p>

<p>
When it was dark and the blind was drawn, and
the little company&mdash;all save Margaret's mother,
who had gone to bed&mdash;drew round the fire to talk
awhile before they separated for the night, the
door opened softly and the mistress of the inn
appeared.  Every eye was turned her way, and
each heart beat quickly when they saw the anxiety
on the woman's face.
</p>

<p>
"What is your will, mistress?" Engel asked, in
little more than a whisper when he marked her
stealth and seriousness, and saw how she closed the
door softly behind her and came towards them
before she said a word.
</p>

<p>
What she said was barely audible, and she
glanced at the door in a way which betrayed her
fears.
</p>

<p>
"If this be Master William Tyndale," she
exclaimed, pointing to him with her forefinger, "and
this sweet young lady Mistress Margaret Byrckmann,
I have news for you that is disturbing."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" asked Margaret, bending forward
in her chair, her rosy cheeks gone pale, while her
startled eyes were fixed on the woman's face.
</p>

<p>
"Are ye whom I think?" the woman asked.
"Tell me truly, for it is no idle curiosity on my
part.  It may be a matter of life or death for two
among you, perhaps for all."
</p>

<p>
"What if we say they are?" asked Master
Byrckmann who was near, and when he caught at
her hand, he felt that she was trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Then you must be gone."
</p>

<p>
"Gone.  But why?" asked Tyndale, who, so
far, had not spoken.
</p>

<p>
"I brought you all up here, Master Tyndale,
because when I saw you enter the inn&mdash;you and
this sweet girl&mdash;I feared that you were those who
are being sought for by Doctor Cochlaeus, who is
hoping to carry you back and lodge you in the
Inquisition dungeon from which this pretty one
escaped."
</p>

<p>
She paused, but none spoke, for the consternation
in every breast robbed them of speech.  Had they
come so far to be captured when so near to safety!
Each longed to know what the danger was which
made it necessary, worn out though they were, to
go out into the night.
</p>

<p>
"You wonder at me, I am sure," the woman
whispered, her eyes on the door while she was
speaking.  "I am one of yourselves, though some
tell me I am one who worships like Naaman in the
house of Rimmon.  But that is not what I came to
say.  I want you to be gone&mdash;to find safety if it
be possible."
</p>

<p>
She went to the door, opened it, and went outside;
then, having glanced down the passage and the
stairs, she came back again.
</p>

<p>
"I'll say more!" she exclaimed, still with her
eyes on the closed door.  "There came to the inn
this afternoon a Churchman, who said that he was
Doctor Cochlaeus, a Deacon of the Church of the
Blessed Virgin.  We all know him for a notorious
heresy hunter.  With him were half a score of
horse soldiers, every one of whom is lodged in this
house, while their horses are in the stables.
</p>

<p>
"While I was serving him he told me he was
looking for an Englishman named Tyndale, who
was busy translating the Scriptures, but had escaped
just when it was thought that he would be captured
and burnt.  He suspected that a young man was
with him, but he was not sure, and perhaps a young
maiden named Margaret Byrckmann, who had
escaped from the House of the Inquisition.  Had
I seen them?  He asked me that, and I answered
truly that I had not.
</p>

<p>
"Now you know!" the woman exclaimed.  "And
you must be gone; but you need not start till
midnight.  I will bid my stableman feed your
horses well, and when the house is quiet he can
muffle their feet in straw and get them away to a
copse just off the road."
</p>

<p>
She left them softly, and presently, from time to
time those who sat about the fire, wondering how
the night would end, heard her voice as she gave
her orders to her maids and serving-men.  During
that long, anxious evening they heard the soldiers
singing their drinking songs.
</p>

<p>
The hours went slowly, and none of them were
able to rest, although Tyndale and Margaret went
to their rooms in the hope of getting some sleep.
Their thoughts were on the perils of the night
journey, and they wondered whether they could
cover the fifteen miles that lay between this inn
and the home of Martin Luther.  Was it possible,
now that Cochlaeus was on their track, that they
would after all fall into the hands of the tormentors?
What if, before they could get away, Cochlaeus
should discover that they were in this house!  All
they could do was to pray in silence, and leave
themselves in the hands of God.
</p>

<p>
"An hour longer, and then it will be midnight,"
said Herman, who, with Margaret, hand in hand
with him, had been looking out of the window,
waiting in the hope that the moon would rise, to make
their going easier.
</p>

<p>
He had scarcely spoken when there came the
sound of a galloping horse, but it pulled up at the
door of the inn, just below the window.
</p>

<p>
"Is Doctor Cochlaeus here?" the horseman
cried, still in his saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," came a woman's voice.  "What is your will?"
</p>

<p>
"I want him this instant.  Go and call him.
Bid him come down from his bed, if he be in it!
Tell him I have news for him."
</p>

<p>
"Come in and see him for yourself," said the
mistress of the inn sharply, not caring for the
man's peremptory orders.  "Why should I obey
the orders of any night rider who chooses to pull
up at my inn door?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot waste my time.  I want to ride elsewhere,"
the man cried irritably.  "Tell him it will
be necessary to come at once.  And look you,
mistress, if you stand idling there, and things should
go awry, Doctor Cochlaeus will make it bad for you."
</p>

<p>
The woman turned away and went into the
house, and the watchers at the window heard the
rider call loudly for a stableman to bring his horse
some water.  The light over the inn door showed
them a man in the saddle of a foam-covered horse
that breathed heavily with his hard journey.  They
could hear the burst of his breath, and still the
man sat on, turning an eager face towards the
door.
</p>

<p>
Someone came out, and Herman and Margaret
knew him.
</p>

<p>
"Cochlaeus," the girl whispered, shivering with
fear and drawing nearer to her lover's side.
</p>

<p>
"What is this news you bring, fellow?" cried
the Churchman, with some asperity at being called
out of his warm bed.
</p>

<p>
The rider did not waste an instant.
</p>

<p>
"My lord of Hautcoeur has a man in his dungeon
who, he says, is that English heretic, William
Tyndale.  He passed the castle gate a few hours
after you had gone, and he bade me ride hard after
you and bring you back at once, that he may get
his troublesome prisoner off his hands, lest he may
escape as he did from the castle of the lord of
Schouts.  Will you come at once?"
</p>

<p>
The rider's strident voice rang through the
night, but the answer was decisive.
</p>

<p>
"Ho, there!  Adam Kraft, call your soldiers to
their saddles.  That fellow, Tyndale, is in the dungeon
at Hautcoeur, and we ride thither at once.  Mistress,
tell your stableman to get my horse ready.  I must
start at once."
</p>

<p>
There was an instant bustle.  One by one the
soldiers came round with their horses, grouping in
the open space before the inn, and their helmets
glanced in the light which streamed from the
passage.  Then came the horse which Cochlaeus
was to ride, and before many minutes, with a
soldier's aid, he was in the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ready?" he asked, looking round
when he had gathered up the reins.  The answering
cry assured him, and, bidding the mistress of the
inn a curt farewell, he spurred his horse and galloped
away into the darkness, followed by his men.  At
every bound he was leaving the man he sought for
farther behind him.
</p>

<p>
The night settled down into silence when the
last of the horsemen had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"They are gone," said Herman, meeting the
woman on the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Now get you gone also, in God's dear
name.  Was ever anything so good?  To think
that my lord of Hautcoeur should think he hath
Master Tyndale in his dungeon!" The woman
clapped her hands in ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis God's doing, mistress," said Herman, and
she looked up at him with glistening eyes.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, with all the lights of the inn
put out, so that nothing should betray their going,
Master Tyndale and the others were on the road.
</p>

<p>
"This is the Lord's doing!" he exclaimed, lifting
his cap reverently; and he had barely spoken before
the horses were on the move.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
<br><br>
THE ELEVENTH HOUR
</h3>

<p>
Although Cochlaeus and his riders had
galloped away, leaving the road apparently
clear towards Worms, the forester was
doubtful as to its safety.  He was afraid
to travel on it lest the Churchman, in his
eagerness to capture Tyndale, had already sent some
armed horsemen forward to intercept him.
</p>

<p>
"The longest way is the quickest and the safest,
Master Tyndale," said the forester, who had been
the first to mount into the saddle, and had, indeed,
gone forward at a canter to look along the road
beyond the bend.
</p>

<p>
"I think so, too!" exclaimed Byrckmann; but
he looked anxiously at his wife, and wondered as
she sat in her rough-and-ready pillion how long
her strength would last after a day of hard
travelling and many dangers, and the sleepless
night.  It was the only way, however; for with
Cochlaeus or his minions riding in the country,
it was best to take the smaller risk, go as gently
as they dared, and keep well out of the beaten
paths.
</p>

<p>
"Just as you think," said Tyndale quietly.
"I am in your hands&mdash;and God's," he added, a
moment later.  "But I fear me Mistress Byrckmann
will find the longer way too much for her
little store of strength."
</p>

<p>
"I can go as far as need calls," the sick woman
answered bravely.  "I am so comfortable here
that a few miles more or less cannot harm me,"
she said; but there was a tremulousness in her
voice which made Margaret watch her mother
anxiously, and she drew closer to her side, leaning
in her saddle to lay her own on the thin,
transparent hand.
</p>

<p>
"It will be all rest, mother, when we get to our
journey's end, and we will not travel fast to shake
you," she said tenderly.  "Will you bear that
in mind, Master Engel?
</p>

<p>
"I will," came the good-natured answer from
the man who had become the natural leader of the
little cavalcade.  "We're going to leave this dusty
and too open road and make for the river, and
then for miles we shall be in forestland.  Isn't
it so, Herman?  You know as well, perhaps better
than I do."
</p>

<p>
"It is so," said Herman, who was going to ride
in the rear, alert for every sound, lest by any
ill-chance the Churchman and his riders had changed
their course, and had not ridden on to Hautcoeur.
</p>

<p>
"How long, think you, will it take Cochlaeus
to get to the Castle of Hautcoeur?" Margaret
asked, after they had been riding nearly an hour
at little more than a leisurely jaunt because of
her mother.
</p>

<p>
"Three hours at the least," said the forester.
</p>

<p>
"And if he discovers that he has been duped,
and decides to ride back to the inn, three hours
more!" Byrckmann exclaimed.  "He will know
as soon as he goes down into the castle dungeon
that he has either been fooled or the lord of
Hautcoeur has been misled.  Then he may come
back in hot haste.  That means, he will be at the
inn again in six hours&mdash;nay, five by now."
</p>

<p>
"By that time we shall be in Worms!" Engel
exclaimed, with apparent carelessness, but by no
means easy in his own mind.  He was disposed
to avoid Worms, and move round the city, or
travel wide of it altogether, rather than run the
risks of any horsemen lying in wait, ruining all
their plans at the eleventh hour.  But, whatever
his own anxiety was, he would not suffer any of
those who were with him to know, unless he took
Herman into his confidence.
</p>

<p>
They rode on at that easy trot, in and out among
the forest, where he seemed so thoroughly at home,
although he did not know it at all, and presently,
turning in his saddle and laying his hand on his
horse's flank, he called to Herman carelessly to
come forward, to talk over the possibilities of the
forest paths.
</p>

<p>
Asking Byrckmann to keep a look out behind,
lest any robber or prowling beast might make
a spring, Herman rode to Engel's side.
</p>

<p>
"You're going all right!" he exclaimed, quite
easy in his mind, knowing nothing of the forester's
misgivings.  "We cannot go wrong if we keep
the river in view most of the time."
</p>

<p>
"I know all that," said Engel, speaking low;
"but my trouble is a twofold one.  First of all,
Cochlaeus may have some of his riders with him,
but not all.  He's out for capturing Master Tyndale,
on whose head there's a very big price, and I've
been thinking that, guessing that he may be
making for Worms, he has sent forward some men
to bar the way, and snatch the poor man out of
our hands."
</p>

<p>
Herman felt himself shiver coldly; then heat
swept over his face, and he brushed away the
dampness from it with his sleeve; for he thought
that if Engel's fear proved true it would not be
Tyndale only who would be in the toils, but his
darling.  His hand went to his dagger, and clutched
the handle convulsively, while he set his teeth in
stern determination that, be the odds however
great, his dear one should not fall into the hands
of the tormentors without a fight.
</p>

<p>
"I never thought of that!" he exclaimed quietly,
that the others should not hear; but his voice was
unsteady.  "When I saw that Churchman ride off
at a gallop I was exultant, and with only fifteen
miles to go, I thought we were as good as safe."
</p>

<p>
Engel shrugged his shoulders, and as they were
riding at the moment in a bit of open, moonlit
glade, Herman saw the movement, and saw as
well the forester's grave face, and how, too, he
had pulled his dagger round for handier usage, in
case of a surprise.
</p>

<p>
"What's the other anxiety?" Herman asked,
remembering that Engel had said that his trouble
was twofold.
</p>

<p>
"When Cochlaeus gets to Hautcoeur, and the
master of the castle takes him down to the dungeon,
he will see at a glance that the prisoner is not the
man he wants.  He will not stay an instant longer,
and I can imagine his chagrin.  I can seem to
see him coming up the steps out of the dungeon in
a whirlwind of anger, and after some maledictions
on the lord of Hautcoeur, he will get his men and
horses out, and they will come back in haste as hot
as when he left the inn."
</p>

<p>
"We have six hours' start," said Herman, easy on
this point.
</p>

<p>
"I know; but mark the pace we're going, and
must go, because of that poor woman in the pillion
behind us.  We can't go faster than she can travel.
It would nearly kill her if we mended the pace.
Given a free hand, we'd be at the gates of Worms
in two hours; but with our going at this pace
Cochlaeus will be there, waiting for us."
</p>

<p>
"Then it's sheer madness to make for Worms!"
exclaimed Herman.  "We must go somewhere
else, and take Worms later."
</p>

<p>
They were in the forest depths again, and although
they were talking they were keeping a keen look out.
Both riders halted suddenly, and the others behind,
brought up unexpectedly, were in a bunch, the
horses beating against each other.
</p>

<p>
There was no necessity for speech.  Each
clutched the horse's reins on which he rode
convulsively, and a thrill of fear passed through them.
</p>

<p>
"Let us get out of this path," whispered the
forester, swinging his horse aside.  "Follow me,
but quietly.  I'm going over there, where it's dark,
and we shall not be seen."  He said it easily, but
he was afraid.
</p>

<p>
As the others drew up with him among some
bushes, so high and dense that no passer-by on
the forest path could see their horses, they watched,
their consternation none the less; for who could
tell what might happen!
</p>

<p>
"Keep perfectly quiet," Engel whispered.  "I
pray the horses may neither neigh nor jingle
their harness."
</p>

<p>
Away on the forest path they saw some
horsemen, they knew not how many.  Some of them
carried flaming torches, the light of which fell on
themselves and their comrades, on their own armour,
which glanced as the light played on it, and on the
weapons and metal trappings of their chargers.
They were soldiers, moving on with a steady-going
easiness, in no great haste, and careless as to
whether they were seen and heard.
</p>

<p>
At first there seemed to be a score of horsemen,
but, as these came on, others emerged from the forest
darkness in their wake, and others after those.  On
and on they came, and presently the foremost rode
past, easily and carelessly, talking, and at odd times
snaps of a soldier's song came.  The cavalcade
moved on, and it seemed to those who watched,
bending low in their saddles and peering through
the bushes that hid them, that there were more
than scores.  They seemed to be hundreds, each
man fully armed.  Then after them came the rolling
wheels of heavy guns drawn by horses who sometimes
strained at the weight when the wheels sank
into the soft moss-grown path.
</p>

<p>
It was a little army, the rear being brought up
by more horsemen, whose faces were lit up by the
flaring torches.
</p>

<p>
The watchers looked anxiously, unconsciously,
indeed, to know whether Cochlaeus was amongst
them, and there was the feeling of intense relief
when they found that he was not.
</p>

<p>
"Where can they be going to?" each asked, as
the last of the horsemen rode out of sight, and no
more light from the torches lit up the forest trees;
but the cavalcade had gone, and the road was free.
</p>

<p>
They started on their way again, Herman and
Engel discussing the alternatives.
</p>

<p>
"Let us take Worms later," said Herman again,
just as he had been saying when the soldiers came
into view.
</p>

<p>
It was one thing to say so much; another thing
to tell where the other place might be; but the
suggestion set the forester thinking.
</p>

<p>
"I know!" he exclaimed, slapping his thigh with
his great hand, and the smart crack made his horse
start.  "I have an uncle&mdash;and he has a daughter&mdash;and
I love her, Herman, just as you love that sweet
girl behind us.  And my cousin loves me."
</p>

<p>
He said all this in little more than a whisper,
but Herman marked the thrill in the forester's
voice.
</p>

<p>
"She lives two miles from here, in a mill like my
father's, and just now she's all alone, for her father's
away, and will not be back for another month.
She can hide us all, and the horses can go out to
graze, and no questions asked, because my uncle
deals in horseflesh freely, making a mint o' money.
I'll only have to say, 'Mary, we're in trouble&mdash;every
one of us, and in danger, too, and it means
the rack for some of us, or worse, if you can't hide
us somewhere.'  And she'll do it.  I know she will,
if only for her love for me; but add to that her
love for what Cochlaeus would call heresy, and we
shall win her care.  Shall we try it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why ask me?" exclaimed Herman, whose
heart was beating high with hope, and who was
thinking of the safety it promised for his darling.
"Turn that way at once, if you know how to get
there."
</p>

<p>
"I've never got there from this side, but always
from across the river, where I know every inch of
the way.  If we get a bit nearer the water I can,
perhaps, get my bearings."
</p>

<p>
They turned away to the right, and soon they saw
the great flood of the noble river rolling steadily on
towards the sea.  Vessels were moving slowly down
the stream, picturesque in the fleeting moonlight,
and a great raft, such as had passed the cavern
when Tyndale was waiting for the coming of the
<i>Marburg</i>, was floating after them.  On the other
side was a ruined castle, scorched and blackened by
fire, and Engel knew it instantly.
</p>

<p>
"A mile and a half higher up the river and we
are there!" he exclaimed; and with low laughter
he added, "And then I shall see my Mary, and have
her in my arms!"
</p>

<p>
He hugged himself in his delight.
</p>

<p>
"You know, Herman, I'd have married her a
year ago, but her father wouldn't hear of my taking
her to that poverty-stricken hut, and I've been
saving for years to get enough to buy a mill.  A
hundred golden crowns more, and the thing's done."
</p>

<p>
He stopped at that, and the exultation passed.
</p>

<p>
"A hundred golden crowns want a lot of getting,"
he said gloomily, a few moments later.  "We shall
be older than we are, and older than I like to think,
by the time I've got them, at the rate I'm going."
</p>

<p>
"They'll come all right, Otto," said Herman
confidently.  "Your ship will come home
unexpectedly.  See if she doesn't."
</p>

<p>
The forester flung aside his gloom, and every
yard they travelled lifted his spirits.  He was
thinking of the girl he loved, and he was soon to
see her.
</p>

<p>
The forest came to an abrupt ending.  Before
them was a broad sweep of open country, at least
two hundred acres of fine grazing land, dotted with
trees and sleeping horses and cattle, and in the
centre of all, standing on a high mound, a fine old
mill, whose arms were motionless.
</p>

<p>
"That's the place!" exclaimed Engel, pulling up
his horse.  Turning in his saddle, he spoke to those
who were behind him.
</p>

<p>
"We must halt here, while I go to the mill and
ask my cousin to give us shelter for a little while."
</p>

<p>
"Why not go on to Worms?" asked Tyndale,
in surprise.  "I thought we only had a few miles
to travel in order to get there."
</p>

<p>
"I did not dare to take you there to-night,
Master Tyndale, lest Cochlaeus should have sent
some horsemen forward to intercept us.  We must
travel slowly to go more safely, and there is secure
hiding in my uncle's mill.  You and Master Roye
can sit somewhere in quietness, and at your ease
you can go on with your work&mdash;as well here as
anywhere.  My cousin can hide you as securely as
though you were with Doctor Luther."
</p>

<p>
"Then I am content, if the others are," said
Tyndale.  "What say you, Master Byrckmann?"
</p>

<p>
"More than content, since it will give my wife
the rest she needs," the printer answered, looking
anxiously at his wife, as the light of the moon
played on her face.
</p>

<p>
"Then let us go forward!" exclaimed Tyndale,
shaking the reins to urge his horse on.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I must go to the mill first," said the
forester, catching at the bridle to prevent Tyndale
from riding into the open.  "Herman, keep a
sharp watch.  Get back, each one of you, into the
shadows, where you can see and not be seen."
</p>

<p>
The forester moved onward while he spoke, and
put his horse to the canter.  They saw him drop
out of the saddle and knock at the door of the mill.
The sound of his loud tapping reached those who
were watching; then a woman's head and her
white linen-covered shoulders appeared at one of
the windows.  They heard an exclamation of
pleasure, and the head and shoulders disappeared,
and before long Engel entered by the open door.
Before many minutes had passed he came away
from the mill, his heavy boots brushing among the
dewy grass.
</p>

<p>
"Come," he cried, before he reached them,
beckoning with his hand.  Before long the whole
company were in the mill; the horses were at the
door, munching oats hungrily, after which they
turned to the meadow to sleep out the remainder of
the night; but as for the others, Mary Engel,
when she had set food before them, went to prepare
for their comfort in the safe hiding-place of which
the forester had spoken.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
Two days went by, and none but Engel ventured
out of the mill.  The others stayed within doors,
always ready to go into hiding if the warning came.
They were content, because they realised the absolute
safety they enjoyed in the great cap of the mill,
into which, when they entered it, they could draw
the ladder, and shut down the heavy trap-door,
leaving the place unsuspected.  From a small
window here and there they could see the country
for miles.  In the far distance was the city that
had been their home.  In the other direction lay
the city they were eager to reach so soon as it was
safe to venture; and between rolled the winding,
stately river, with its rich forest beauty, and hiding
among the trees lay castles that won for
themselves a doubtful reputation.
</p>

<p>
William Tyndale was absorbed in his work, but
the others often watched what was going on outside.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear the sound of firing?" Margaret
asked, one fine evening, before she would say
"Good-night," and go to bed.  She was gazing
out of the window while she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I heard it!" Herman exclaimed, coming to
her side, and taking his place at the tiny window.
"There it is again.  And again.  'Tis like the
discharge of cannon."
</p>

<p>
The cannonading lasted for some time, and they
listened in wonder, but thought of those soldiers
and the cannon that had passed them in the forest.
</p>

<p>
"Does it mean war, Herman?" Margaret asked.
</p>

<p>
"I can't think it does," he answered.
</p>

<p>
At last the sounds were gone, and the night
silence settled over the country which was now
in darkness.  They were about to kiss each other
and say "Good-night," when Margaret pointed
to a distant spot towards her old home.  A dense
cloud of smoke was rising, and flames were leaping
up amongst it, like forked and fiery tongues, and
lighting up the broken clouds.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a fire!" she exclaimed, and the others
came to look through another of the windows
from which the little wooden shutter had been
flung back.  "But what place can it be?"
</p>

<p>
"It must be Schouts' castle!" Herman cried.
"I'm certain of it!" he added, when he had
scanned the country and was able to judge the
distance of the burning mass from the city.
</p>

<p>
As the hours passed the flames died down, and
later still the clouds of smoke dwindled away,
leaving nothing but a red light in the sky.  But
in time there came the sound of a terrific explosion
which seemed to shake the mill.  It came again;
and after that there was a hush, and the countryside
subsided into silence and dense darkness.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to find out what it means," said
the forester; "but while I'm away be careful.
Do whatever Mary says."
</p>

<p>
He moved down the ladder swiftly, and before
long he was riding through the forest with his
faithful dog at his heels.  He did not return until
next day; the moon had risen, but none had gone
to bed, all being eager to know what he had seen,
if he should return that night.
</p>

<p>
"You can have easy minds!" he exclaimed, when
he and his cousin had mounted the ladder, he to
tell the news, and she to hear it.  "Sit down,
every one of you," he said, with laughter in his
face and eyes, and exultation in his voice.  "'Tis
fine news!"
</p>

<p>
As if to tantalise them all, he began to talk of
trivialities&mdash;things that had no concern for any of them.
</p>

<p>
"Don't torment us, Otto," said his sweetheart,
shaking him, as he sat at her side.
</p>

<p>
"I won't, then!" he exclaimed.  "But what an
impatient body it is," he added, turning to look
Mary in the face.  "But 'tis this.  Schouts has
been so much a terror of late that the river became
impassable, and men would stand it no longer.
Even the Emperor, to whom appeal was made,
outlawed him; but he tortured the messenger,
and drowned him in his moat.  That roused His
Majesty, and he determined to deal with him as
one would deal with a savage beast who is a
menace to society.  He took his steps accordingly.
</p>

<p>
"A ship went down the stream&mdash;an innocent-looking
craft, apparently full of merchandise, and
the great bell of the castle rang out its loudest,
and Schouts and his men went down the grass
slope and boarded her.  They found her empty
of life, save for a man at the helm, and the moment
the first of Schouts' soldiers clambered on board
he dropped into the river and swam ashore.  Then
to Schouts' horror, as I suppose, cannon roared
out at the ship from amid the forest on both
sides of the stream and sank the boats that carried
his soldiers to the vessel.  Soon her deck became
a shambles.  The robber lord and his men were
caught like rats in a trap.  Schouts sprang
overboard, to swim back and look to the safety of his
castle, but a cannon shot caught him at the leap,
and he fell dead in the stream, for he sank like
a stone, and his heavy armour helped to drag
him down.  None who leapt into the water
escaped, whichever bank they thought to reach.
Man after man was hit, and seen to throw up his
hands, and sink.
</p>

<p>
"Cries and the sound of guns had all the time
been coming from the castle.  There, too, the
soldiers who had been sent to deal with the building
itself were busy.  The sound of the first shot fired
at the decoy vessel was the signal to hundreds
of soldiers who were hiding in the forest, close up
to the castle moat.  They swept out of the dense
shadows in silence, and rushed across the
drawbridge before the amazed wardens could drop the
portcullis.  In a few minutes the soldiers were
swarming through the robber's stronghold, killing
wherever there was resistance.  So many of Schouts'
servitors and fighting men had gone to the river
to take part in the attack on the ship that little
more than a handful were left to guard the castle,
and these were either slain, or threw up their
hands in token of surrender.
</p>

<p>
"Then came the task of searching every corner,
from roof to dungeon.  Three or four men of note
had lately been carried there, and were to be found,
if they yet lived.  In some of the horrible cells, like
that into which they had thrust Master Tyndale,
the Emperor's soldiers found some prisoners&mdash;poor
creatures who had refused or could not pay
the preposterous ransom, some of them nearly
dead, and more than one demented with the
horror and the loneliness.  Such as could walk
came out tottering, but others had to be carried,
and were set down in the banqueting-hall, where
they were fed and tended by the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"But, strangest thing of all," exclaimed the
forester, and those who listened wondered at the
look on his face&mdash;"I would that Master Tyndale
were with us in this room to hear what next I
have to say," Engel said, breaking off in his story;
"but the good man is buried in that holy task
of his, and I must tell him of it later on."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, friend Engel, he is here, and has heard
the whole story!" someone exclaimed, and, looking
round, those who were gathered about the
forester saw William Tyndale standing in the
doorway.  "Go on, friend," he added, coming in
and sitting on a stool.  "You were saying, 'But,
strangest thing of all.'"
</p>

<p>
"I was, Master Tyndale, and it was the strangest
thing&mdash;the most unexpected.  The soldiers were
searching the castle to rifle it of its contents,
thinking to carry its treasures away, and the
booty the robber lord had taken from many an
unfortunate ship, when they came across a body,
lying in that room where you and I, Herman,
had seen and heard Cochlaeus bargaining with the
lord of the castle for Master Tyndale's ransom.  He
was lying face downwards on one of the costly
rugs, and when they turned him over, marvelling
to find a Churchman of high rank in such a place,
they saw that he was none other than the Deacon
of the Church of the Blessed Virgin."
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried Tyndale, startled at the words,
and rising to his feet.  "Do you mean to say
that it was Cochlaeus?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, Master Tyndale.  How he came to the
castle, and why, I cannot say.  Whether he thought
that after all Schouts had cheated him into believing
that Master Tyndale had escaped, and that in
reality he was in the castle after all, there is no
telling.  No one is left to tell the story.  Some
hard words must have been spoken on both sides,
and Schouts, filled with mad anger at what the
Churchman said, must have struck at him, for
he lay there, dead, and a jewelled dagger was
driven into his heart.
</p>

<p>
"When the castle had been thoroughly rifled,
and all its valuables lay in great heaps on the
grass outside, booty waiting to be divided among
the Emperor's soldiery, the officer commanding
fired the place.  When the fire had nearly burnt
itself out, and the soldiers were about to move
round to see that the destruction was complete,
there was an awful explosion.  The fire had reached
the powder magazine down in the dungeons.
Another explosion followed; then a third; and
after that, when the smoke had cleared away,
there was nothing but a heap of ruins.
</p>

<p>
"And there was the last of Schouts, the robber
lord, and the last of your tormentors, Master
Tyndale," said Engel quietly, turning towards him.
"The man who was so eager to carry you to the
tormentors, and bring your work to naught, is dead."
</p>

<p>
There was silence.  Everyone realised the
meaning of that tragedy at the castle by the river.
It meant much for law and order, since a
brutal-minded, godless, and tyrannical nobleman had
come to the end of his infamous career.  It meant
that Master Tyndale was no longer a hunted
fugitive.  The man who had set himself to bring
about his ruin was gone, and the simple-souled
and lowly-minded scholar was free to go where
he listed&mdash;to stay in the mill, or move on to
Worms&mdash;and Cochlaeus would no more dog his steps.
</p>

<p>
"This is the Lord's doing," said Tyndale
solemnly, and breaking the silence.  "Let us kneel
and thank Him for saving us in this eleventh hour."
</p>

<p>
He dropped on his knees, and when the others did
the same, he poured out his soul in grateful thanks.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Two days later those who were with him rode
into Worms&mdash;all save Mary Engel, who remained
in the mill.  As the horses crossed the bridge at
the city gate they turned to look back on the road
they had travelled, and their faces were lit up
with the glory of the evening sun.
</p>

<p>
"At evening time it shall be light," said Tyndale
softly, and, shaking his horse's rein, he rode along the
street after asking the warden of the gate where
they would find the home of Doctor Martin Luther.
</p>

<p>
It was early next morning when Luther and
Tyndale gave their benediction, and Margaret and
Herman were married in the church where Luther
preached.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later the forester was in the saddle,
ready to ride back to Mary, and his eyes were
twinkling with mirth, and his face had never been
broader with smiles.
</p>

<p>
He called Herman to him when he had said
"Good-bye" to all the others.  Bending in his
saddle, while his dog was waiting, impatient to be
gone, he put out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Shake it, Herman, and in the dear Lord's name
wish me joy!"
</p>

<p>
Herman gazed into his face, wondering at it.
</p>

<p>
"What for?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I am going to marry Mary to-morrow,
please God, if she'll only say 'Yes'; and I believe
she will.  Master Byrckmann has forced two
hundred golden crowns upon me for what he
calls my splendid service.  I didn't think of any
payment, God knows! and I didn't want to take
it, big though the temptation was to do so.  But
he gave me no alternative.  See!  It is here!"
</p>

<p>
He slapped his hand on the leathern pouch at
his belt, and Herman heard the chink of gold.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted a hundred crowns, I told you, to buy
a mill&mdash;and I know of one&mdash;but this leaves me
with a hundred in reserve.  Bid me joy, Herman!
You said my ship would come home.  It's come!"
</p>

<p>
"I do, with all my heart!" Herman cried.
</p>

<p>
And a moment later the forester was galloping
along the street towards the city gate.
